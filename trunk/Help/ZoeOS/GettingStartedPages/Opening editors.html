<h1 id="editing_presets_and_voices" class="default">Opening Presets and Voices</h1>
<h3 id="opening_presets" class="default">Presets</h3>
	<p>
	Presets can be opened by double clicking a preset in the presets palette or by invoking the preset_Open ZCommand
	on one or more presets. Invocation on multiple presets opens all the presets.
<h3 id="opening_voices" class="default">Voices</h3>
	<p>	
	If the device property "Double-click voice editing" is true, voices can be opened by double-clicking a voice on the far left column of the preset voices table.
	<p>
	There are also three voice ZCommands for voice editing (you will need to select some voices to access them).
	<ul>
		<li>
			voice_OpenV - opens the voice in a similar way to editing a single voice from the front-panel. If multiple voices
			form the target set for the command, each voice gets its own editor.
		</li>	
		<li>
			voice_OpenG - opens a voice in group mode that is similar to editing a group from the front-panel.
			The selected voices forming the target set must all have the same group to have this command activated.
			Typically you would select just a single voice and invoke this command to edit that voices group.
		</li>	
		<li>
			voice_OpenC - this mode is a feature unique to ZoeOS. The selected voices that make up the target set for this command
			are edited as a collection. This is very similar to editing multiple voices in group mode, except that the user
			can arbitrarily select the voices that are part of the collection (or software group if you wish to call it that).
			This is a very convenient way to edit multiple voices without having to make them part of the same group.
		</li>	
	</ul>
