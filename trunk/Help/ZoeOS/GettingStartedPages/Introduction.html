<h4 id="welcome" class="default"><b>Welcome to the ZoeOS Getting Started guide</b></h4>

<p>
While there is nothing difficult about using ZoeOS, it is advanced software designed to significantly enhance the usability of your Emulator sampler.
It is assumed that you have working knowledge using the Emulator from the front panel and it is not in this brief to reproduce or re-present
any information in the Emulator manual as written by E-MU.
If you are new to the Emulator world and have never read the manual, we suggest taking a look there first
 - this guide will use Emulator terminology freely with the assumption that the meaning is understood.
<p>
This Getting Started guide will provide a general overview of the applications functionality, taking take the approach of providing pertinent information only.
<!--
<ul>
	<li>
	As you journey with ZoeOS, remember one guiding principle that is true for all well-designed systems (software, physical or otherwise)
	<br> <b><i>"the phenomena is the theory"</i></b>.
	</li>
	<li>
	If you find yourself overloaded with choices during the music making process always follow natures evolutionary agenda and 
	<br><b><i>"roll with what works (and sounds) best!"</i></b>
	</li>
</ul>
