<H1>Searching for Strings</H1>
Use the string searcher to search for strings of text in
specified files.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" WIDTH=18
HEIGHT=13><strong>To search for a string of text:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open the String Search dialog box in one of the
following ways:
<ul>
<li>Click on <IMG SRC=../images/tb-string-search_u.gif
ALIGN=BOTTOM  WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=24>.
<li>Choose Browse -> String Search.
</ul>
<li>Type the text that you wish to search for in the String
box.  Use the Ignore Case check box to turn case
sensitivity on or off.
<p>

<br>
This
version of JDE does not support regular
expressions; only the characters that you specify are used.
<li>Set whether to search the current
project or a specified directory:
<ul>
<li>Click Current Project to limit the search to those
source files you included as part of the current
project when you created it.
<li>Click Directory to focus the search on a specified directory
and enter the path of the directory to search
</ul>
<li>Set the scope of your search:
<ul>
<li>Use the File Types box to specify the types of files
to search.  File types are specified by their suffixes.
Items in the list are separated by a space.  You can add or
delete files from this list. By default <code>.java</code> and
<code>.html</code> are included.
<li>Use the Recursive Search check box to control whether the
search descends into sub-projects (Current Project) or directories beneath the one you
specify (Directory).  By default, the search descends recursively.
</ul>
<li>You can start the search in two ways:
<ul>
<li>Press Enter or Return after you type the text in the
String box.
<li>Click Search.
</ul>
<li>The results of the search are displayed in the String
Search tab at the bottom of the main window.  Each line
consists of:
<ul>
<li>The name of a file found to contain the string (the
file name is a link to the file)
<li>The line number on which the match was found
<li>The text of the matched line
</ul>
<li>Click on the file name link to display the file in the
JDE source editor.  Choose Browse
-> Next and Browse ->
Previous to move from match to match.
</ol>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=13><strong>To stop a search, choose Browse -> Stop Search.</strong>
