<H1>Browsing Class Files</H1>
If the sources are available, the JDE class
viewer enables you to browse the classes, methods, and
comments that constitute a program. The class viewer is
based on <A HREF="javadoc.html"><tt>javadoc</tt></A>,
the Java API Documentation Generator.
<p>
The class viewer extracts information from the program's
source files and presents it in a format that you can use
to:
<ul>
<li>Understand how the program's classes are derived and
easily follow links to the source of classes that the
program extends (if available)
<li>Display the methods contained in the program and easily
follow links to their definitions in source files
<li>View special comments included in the source by the
author (see <A
HREF="javadoc.html"><tt>javadoc</tt></A> for details)
</ul>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To browse a
program:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Choose Browse -> View Classes to
open the View Classes dialog box.
<li>Specify the source files you wish to
browse. There are two ways to do that:
<ul>
<li>Click the Current Project radio button. This enables
you to browse the source files you included as part of the
current <A HREF="../manager/Projects.html">project</A> when you
created it.
<li>Click the Directory radio button, then specify the
directory name in the text box.  This enables you to browse
the source files (with a <code>.java</code> suffix) in the
directory that you specify in the text box.  Press Return
or click Show Files to browse the directory.
</ul>
By default, the current project is automatically selected.

<li>Use the Recursive check box to control whether the
search descends into sub-projects (Current Project) or
directories beneath the one you specify (Directory).  By
default, the search descends recursively.
<li>The list of source files is loaded into the class viewer
list area. Click on the file in the list that you wish
to browse and its information is displayed in the window.
<p>
When you follow a link to view information, the appropriate
source file is automatically loaded into the JDE
source editor.
</ol>
