<h1>Exercise Two: Editing Build Attributes</h1>
In this exercise, you will customize how Java WorkShop builds the program. 
<p>
This project works with the Blink project and the previous lessons in Tutorials One and Two. If you haven't edited the run attributes in the previous exercise, you should do so now using the instructions in <a href="editlesson.html">Editing Run Attributes</a>.

<ol>
<li>Check the project manager for the name of the current project.
<br>If the current project is not Blink, double-click on the Blink project name.
<li>In the project manager, choose Project -> Edit.
<br>The Edit Project window displays four tabs: General, Build, Debug/Browse, and Run.
<li>Click the Build tab.
<br>The attributes in this tab are used to define how you want to build the program.
<li>Click Options.
<br>The Java Compiler Options dialog box is displayed.
<li>Make sure Enable generation of debugging tables is selected.
<li>Click OK.
<li>Click OK in the Edit Project window.
