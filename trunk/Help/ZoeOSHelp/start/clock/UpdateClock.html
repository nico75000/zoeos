<h1>Exercise 10: Updating DeskClock</h1>

In this exercise, you will update the Clock bean in the DeskClock
project by reimporting the <tt>Clock.jar</tt> file that you modified in
the previous exercise to the component library. You will also update
the DeskClock project to use this latest version.

<ol>
<li>Make sure you are in the DeskClock project. Open the Project
Manager window and check to see that DeskClock is highlighted. If not,
double-click on the DeskClock name to open the project.
<li>Choose GUI -> Import Components to Palette.
<li>Click the Browse button on the JAR tab.
<li>Load the <tt>Clock.jar</tt> file, which contains the modified Clock bean.
<li>In the JAR page, click on <tt>Clock.class</tt> to select it.
<li>Click on the Beans folder name in the Palette Components list.
<li>Click the Add button that is between the JAR page and the
Palette Components list.
<li>Click OK to add the beans to the palette.
<p>
An automatic update occurs for all the beans in
<tt>Clock.jar</tt>. You wiil be notified that an update has been detected.
<li>Click Import and Upgrade when the Upgrade detected dialog box opens.
<li>Click Reload Design in the Reload Design After Update dialog box
opens.
<p>
Look in the layout window and check that the name of the month appears
larger.
<li>Click Build in the main toolbar.
<li>Click Run in the main toolbar after the build completes. Your
DeskClock should look like this now:
