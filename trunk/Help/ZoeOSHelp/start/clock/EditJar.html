<h1>Exercise 9: Modifying Clock</h1>

In this exercise, you will make a change to the Clock bean and
rebuild the bean. When you are done, the version of <tt>Clock.jar</tt> in the
Beans project will be different than the version in the DeskClock GUI
project.

<ol>
<li>Open the Project Manager window and double-click the project name
<tt>Clock</tt> in the project list.
<p>
If you did not quit the DeskClock project after the previous exercise,
you will be asked if you want to save and quit the current project; click
Save and Quit. Click Switch in the next dialog box to change projects. 
<li>After the Clock project is opened, open the <tt>Clock.java</tt> file
by double-clicking on <tt>Clock.java</tt> (in the Clock project file
list) in the project manager.  
<li>In the source editor, scroll to this line in <tt>Clock.java</tt>:
<br><code>monthFont = new Font("Helvetica",Font.ITALIC,8);</code> <br>
and change the font size of <tt>8</tt> to <tt>12</tt>.
<p>
If you cannot edit <Clock.java</tt>, check to see that you have changed
the permissions for the file.
<li>Click Save <img
src="../../images/file-save_u.gif" align=BOTTOM> on the
Edit/Debug toolbar to save your edits.  <li>Click Build <img
src="../../images/tb-build_u.gif" align=MIDDLE> on the main
toolbar to compile your file.
</ol>
