<h1>Exercise 5:  Importing the Beans</h1>

In this exercise you will create a new tab in the GUI builder palette and
import the Clock, Marquee, and SoundPlayer beans to the palette.

<h2>Create a New Palette Tab</h2>

In this part of the exercise you are going to create a new tab called
Beans.

<ol>
<li>Choose GUI -> Import Components to Palette.
<li>Click New Folder under the Palette Components list.
<li>Type <kbd>Beans</kbd> in the Folder text box and click OK in the Name
new palette folder dialog box.
<li>Look in the list of palette components to verify that the Bean
folder was created.
</ol>

Keep the Import Components to Palette dialog box open and proceed to the
next part of the exercise, Import the Beans.

<h2>Import the Beans</h2>

When you import the beans in <tt>Clock.jar</tt>, you will place them
in the new Beans tab of the palette:

<ol>
<li>Click the Browse button on the JAR tab.
<li>Load the <tt>Clock.jar</tt> file in your <tt>Clock</tt> project directory.
<li>In the JAR page, select <tt>Clock.class</tt>, <tt>Marquee.class</tt>, and
<tt>SoundPlayer.class</tt>.
<li>Click on the Beans folder name in the Palette Components list.
<p>
The Add button is activated when both the class and the folder names
are selected. 
<li>Click the Add button that is between the JAR tab and the
Palette Components list.
<li>Check the components list to see if the beans have been added
to the Beans folder.
<li>Click OK to add the beans to the palette.
<li>In the GUI builder palette, click the Beans tab.
<p>
You should see custom icons for Clock and Marquee and a default
icon for SoundPlayer.

</ol>

You have successfully imported the beans into the palette. When the
beans were imported, shadow classes were automatically generated for
each bean class and added to the JAR file. This modified version of
the JAR file was then stored in the component library (the <tt>Imported
Components</tt> directory).
