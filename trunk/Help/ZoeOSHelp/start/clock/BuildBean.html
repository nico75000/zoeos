<h1>Exercise 3: Building the Project</h1>
This exercise explains how to build the Clock project. If you haven't yet created the Clock project, you should do so now using the steps in <a href="CreateBean.html">Creating the Clock Project</a>.
<ol>
<li>Check the Java WorkShop Project Manager window for the name of the current project.
<br>If the current project is not Clock, double-click on the Clock project name.
<li>In the project manager, double-click on <code>Clock.java</code> in the Clock project.
<br>The source editor displays the <code>Clock.java</code> source code that was copied from the <code>examples</code> directory.
<li>Click the Build button <img src="../../images/tb-build_u.gif" align=BOTTOM> on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<br>Watch the Build tab (below the source editor) as Java WorkShop builds your project. The status message "Done" appears in the Build tab when your sources are finished building and compiling.
</ol>
