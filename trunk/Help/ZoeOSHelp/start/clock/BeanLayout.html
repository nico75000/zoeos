<h1>Exercise 6:  Designing DeskClock</h1>

In this exercise, you will add the beans to the DeskClock layout and
edit some of their properties.

<ol>
<li>Open the attribute editor for the frame container and select the frame,
<tt>Unnamed Frame</tt>, in the Windows list. The Windows list is to
the right of the component palette.
<li>Type <kbd>DeskClock</kbd> in the title text box and click OK.
<li>Click on the Beans tab to expose the Beans folder if it is not
already displayed.
<li>Click on the Clock bean, and then click in the top left cell in the grid.
<p>
Once the bean has been placed in the grid, it has been
instantiated. A copy of the bean's JAR file is automatically put in
the project directory.
<li>Click on the Marquee bean in the palette and click in the bottom
cell.
<li>Click on the SoundPlayer bean.
<p>
Because SoundPlayer is an invisible bean, it does not appear in the
layout window. To verify that the bean has been selected, look at the
Windows list and see if SoundPlayer is listed. Currently, each
time an invisible bean is selected, its name appended to the Windows
list.
<li>To reduce visual clutter, remove the unused cells in the grid by
clicking in the upper-right cell in the grid and choosing GUI
-> Delete Component. Repeat until only the column containing
the beans remains. 
<li>Click in the bottom cell and choose GUI -> Delete
Component to remove the empty cell. 
<p>
You should now have a grid that contains one column with two rows of
cells:
