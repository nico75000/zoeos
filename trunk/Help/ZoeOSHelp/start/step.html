<h1>Exercise 4: Stepping Through a Method</h1>

Stepping through your code is another way to get to the line that is causing a problem. In this exercise, you will learn to step through code and track the changes in variable values in the Threads/Stack window. You will also learn how to remove a breakpoint.
<ol>
<li>Click the Over button <img src="../images/db-step-over_u.gif" align="BOTTOM"><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> in the Edit/Debug toolbar.
<br>Java WorkShop executes one source line and stops in:
<p>
<kbd>If (Math.random() < 0.5) {</kbd>
<p>
The source editor highlights the line with the breakpoint in red, and the line in which program execution stopped in green. If the line had been a method call, the Step Over command would run to the next line in the program. If the line had been a method call and you issued the Step Into command, Java WorkShop would execute the first statement of the method and stop.
<p>
The Threads/Stack window shows the current state of the program and its data. For example, <kbd>Blink.paint</kbd> now indicates it is stopped in line 49.
<li>Click the Over button two more times and watch how the debugger steps through your program.
<li>In the source editor, move the pointer to line 45, which has a breakpoint.
<li>Click the Breakpoint <img src="../images/db-stop-at_u.gif" align=MIDDLE> button.
<br>
Java WorkShop removes the breakpoint.
</ol>
