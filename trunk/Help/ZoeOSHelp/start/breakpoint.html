<h1>Exercise 2: Setting a Breakpoint</h1>

Setting a breakpoint is useful to track down trouble spots in your program. In this exercise, you will set a breakpoint in <kbd>Blink.java</kbd> while the program is running. The program runs to the breakpoint and stops.
<p>
The source line numbers given in this tutorial assume you have added the additional code given in <a href="editcode.html">Editing Source Code</a>.

<ol>
<li>Choose Debug -> Breakpoints.
<br>The Java WorkShop Breakpoints window is displayed.

<li>Type <kbd>Blink</kbd> in the Class name box.

<li>Type <kbd>45</kbd> in the Location box.</b>

<li>Click Set Breakpoint.
<br>The source editor highlights the line:
<br><pre>     if (x + w > d.width) {</pre>
<p>
This line was chosen so that you can track the change in the values of variables as the program goes through the loop. In most cases, you will set a breakpoint in a line where you think a bug occurs in your program.
</ol>
<p>
Java WorkShop runs the program until it reaches the breakpoint. The line containing the new breakpoint changes to green to indicate where program execution stopped. The Threads/Stack window is updated.
