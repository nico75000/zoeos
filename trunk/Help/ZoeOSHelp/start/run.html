<h1>Exercise 3:  Running the Project</h1>

In this exercise, you will run the Blink project using the HTML file that Java WorkShop created.

<ol>
<li>Check the project manager for the name of the current project.
<br>If the current project is not Blink, double-click on the Blink project name.
<li>Click the Run button <img src="../images/tb-run_u.gif" align=BOTTOM> on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<br>Java WorkShop generates the HTML file in your <kbd>Blink</kbd> directory. This HTML file includes the <applet> tag, which specifies the options to use when placing the Blink project on a web page. Java WorkShop loads the file into the applet viewer, and you can see the Blink project executing.  The word "Blink" blinks on and off, in different colors.
<li>To stop the running applet, choose Applet -> Quit in the Applet Viewer window.
</ol>
