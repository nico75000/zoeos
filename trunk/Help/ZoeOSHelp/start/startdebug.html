<h1>Exercise 1: Starting a Debugging Session</h1>

This exercise shows how to start debugging the Blink project. If you haven't yet created and built the Blink project, you should do so now using the instructions in <a href="create.html">Creating the Blink Project</a>.

<ol>
<li>Check the project manager for the name of the current project.
<br>The <code>Blink.java</code> file should be displayed in the source editor. If the current project is not Blink, double-click on the Blink project name.
<li>Click the Restart button <img src="../images/db-restart_u.gif" align=BOTTOM> on the Edit/Debug toolbar.
<br>The execution of <code>Blink.java</code> begins. And Java WorkShop executes the Blink project in the Applet Viewer window. 
</ol>
<p>
While <code>Blink.java</code> is running, you can set a breakpoint by choosing Debug -> Breakpoints. You can also suspend the program by choosing Debug -> Interrupt Program.
