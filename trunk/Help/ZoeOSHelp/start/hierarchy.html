<h1>Exercise 1: Viewing the Class Hierarchy</h1>

In this exercise, you will learn how the classes in the Blink project are derived.
<ol>
<li>Check the project manager for the name of the current project.
<br>If the current project is not Blink, double-click on the Blink project name.

<li>Choose Browse -> View Classes.
<br>Java WorkShop opens the class viewer, which lists the classes, methods, and comments that make up the Blink project. The project has one source file, <kbd>Blink.java</kbd>.

<li>Click on <kbd>Blink.java</kbd>.
<br>The class viewer loads the classes from which <kbd>Blink</kbd> is derived. <br><kbd>Blink</kbd> is derived from <kbd>Applet</kbd>, which is derived from <kbd>Panel</kbd>, and so on.
<p>
The class viewer information is derived from <a href="../sbrowse/javadoc.html">javadoc</a>, the Java API Documentation Generator. Javadoc parses the declaration and comments in the project's source code and formats the API into HTML code.
</ol>
