<h1>Exercise 1:  Creating a Public Portfolio</h1>

This exercise shows you how to create a public portfolio; other users on the Internet will be able to access the projects in this portfolio. 

<ol>
<li><b>Choose Portfolio => Create.</b>
<br>This action opens the Create Portfolio dialog box.
<p>
<li><b>In the text field, enter a portfolio path name accessible by your HTTP server.</b>
<br>
A portfolio name must end in the extension <kbd>.psf</kbd>.  For example, on Solaris computing environments, to create the portfolio <kbd>graphics.psf</kbd> in the directory <kbd>/smith/public_html/folios</kbd>, you would enter <kbd>/smith/public_html/folios/graphics.psf</kbd>.
<p>  
<li><b>Click the Create button.</b>
<br>The Java WorkShop makes the portfolio the current portfolio. Other WorkShop users on the Internet can view the portfolio you created by entering the portfolio URL in the browser.  In the next lesson, you will learn how to copy a project into the portfolio.
</ol>
