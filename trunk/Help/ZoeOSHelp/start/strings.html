<h1>Exercise 3: Finding Strings in Your Code</h1>

In this exercise, you will learn how to find all occurrences of a specified string in your source code. You will then view the matches with their surrounding source code.

<ol>
<li>Check the project manager for the name of the current project.
<br>If the current project is not Blink, double-click on the Blink project name.
<li>Click the Search button <img src="../images/tb-string-search_u.gif" align=BOTTOM><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif">on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<li>Enter <kbd>green</kbd> in the String box.
<li>Click Search.
<br>A match is any occurrence of the string in your source code. The string searcher finds two matches of the string <kbd>green</kbd> and displays the matches in the String Search tab below the source editor window. The matches are displayed in the form: <i>filename: line_number</i>. You will also see the source code line that contains the string.

<li>Click the link for the first match, <kbd>Blink.java:32</kbd>.
<br>The source editor displays the source line containing the string. The line is highlighted in blue.

<li>Choose Browse -> Next Match.
<br>The source editor highlights the code for the next match.
</ol>
