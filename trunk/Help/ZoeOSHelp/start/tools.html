<h1>Java WorkShop Tools</h1>

The Java WorkShop tools are represented by buttons on the Java WorkShop main toolbar (located below the menubar).
<p>
The main toolbar buttons include:
<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/tb-build_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Build</strong>
<dd>Builds the current project. If your project contains errors, the Build tab reports the errors and links to your source code.

<dt><img src="../images/tb-run_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Run</strong>
<dd>Runs the current project. If your project is an applet, an HTML file is created and run in the applet viewer. If your project is a standalone program, the output will go to the console. You cannot run a Java package or a bean.

<dt><img src="../images/tb-profile_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Profile</strong>
<dd>Runs the Profiler. Produces a report showing how much time is spent in each program method and how many times each method is executed.

<dt><img src="../images/tb-string-search_u.gif" align=MIDDLE>
<img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Search</strong>
<dd>Finds references to strings of text in specified source files.  

<dt><img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=MIDDLE>
<img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Projects</strong>
<dd>Creates, imports, edits, and removes projects.
<p>Projects are the cornerstone of Java WorkShop. A project keeps track of the various files needed to build, browse, run, and debug a project in Java WorkShop. Projects are grouped together into portfolios. The following project types are available in Java WorkShop:
<ul>
<li><strong>Applet.</strong> A program that is written in the Java language and runs in a browser that supports Java, such as HotJava

<li><strong>Standalone program.</strong> A program written in the Java language that runs outside a web browser, usually from an MS-DOS command window or a shell tool in the UNIX operating environment

<li><strong>Java package.</strong> A group of Java classes declared with the same package name
<li><strong>Java beans.</strong> Reusable software components that can be worked on in the GUI builder
</ul>

<dt><img src="../images/vj_attributes_up.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Attributes</strong>
<dd>Edits properties of interface components in GUI builder projects.

<dt><img src="../images/tb-help_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"><strong>Help</strong>
<dd>Provides information about Java WorkShop. You can get help in several different ways:
<ul>
<li>Click the Help button (the question mark) on the Java WorkShop main toolbar to get information about the main toolbar buttons.
<li>Click the Help button (the question mark) on the Edit/Debug toolbar to get information about the Edit/Debug toolbar buttons.
<li>In the Help menu, choose an item for which you want help.
<li>In a dialog box or tab, click the Help button.
</ul>
<p>
If you are not sure of what action a button performs, you can get a description of the button by placing the pointer over it. The description appears in the browser's footer.
