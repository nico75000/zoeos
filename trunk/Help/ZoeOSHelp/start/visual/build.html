<h1>Exercise 7: Building and Running the Project</h1>

In this exercise, you will build the Calculator project. You will then generate an HTML file that runs the Calculator project.
<ol>
<li>Click the Build button <img src="../../images/tb-build_u.gif" align=MIDDLE> on the main toolbar.
<br>Java WorkShop compiles the <kbd>Calculator.java</kbd> program into the <kbd>Calculator.class</kbd> file of bytecode. The Build tab, below the source editor, displays a "Build Succeeded" message when the build is complete. You should not get any error messages in the source code. If you mistyped one of the button names, fix the error as follows:
<ol>
<li>Select the button in the layout window.
<li>Type the correct name in the name box in the attribute editor and click Apply.
<li>Rebuild the project.
</ol>
<li>Click the Run button <img src="../../images/tb-run_u.gif" align=BOTTOM> on the main toolbar.
<br>Java WorkShop generates the HTML file <kbd>Calculator.tmp.html</kbd> in your project directory. The HTML file includes the <applet> tag, which specifies the options to use when placing the Calculator project on a web page. Java WorkShop loads the file into the applet viewer. Try out the calculator.
<li>To stop the running project, choose Applet -> Quit.
</ol>
