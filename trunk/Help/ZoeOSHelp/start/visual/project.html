<H1>Exercise 1: Creating the Calculator Project</H1>

Now that you've determined the design, you will create a project to keep track of the files that build your application. In this exercise, you will create an applet project named Calculator, which you will build using the Visual Java GUI builder. The GUI builder provides the tools you need to assemble a working application.

<ol>
<li>Click the Projects <img src="../../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=BOTTOM><img src="../../../images/spacer2_t.gif">button on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<br>The Java WorkShop Project Manager window is displayed.
<li>Check the project manager for the name of the current portfolio--the current portfolio name is shown in blue text.
<br>If the current portfolio is not <code>personal</code>, double-click on the personal portfolio name. If you do not have a personal portfolio, see <a href="../import.html">Adding Your Personal Portfolio</a>.
<li>In the Project Manager window, choose File -> New -> Project.
<li>In the Create Project wizard, select <kbd>untitled</kbd> and type <kbd>Calculator</kbd> in the project name box.
<br>Make sure you capitalize the "C" in Calculator. Java is case-sensitive. The project name <code>Calculator</code> follows the Java convention of initial capitalization.
<li>Make sure the Applet radio button is selected.
<li>Make sure the radio button for using the Visual Java GUI builder tool is selected.
<li>Click Next.
<br>In this tutorial you should store the project in the default directory.
<li>Make sure the No radio button for existing files is selected.
<li>Click Next.
<li>Make sure the Use generated Html page radio button is selected.
<li>Click Finish.
<br>The following actions occur:

<ul>
<li>The source editor displays a template for you to use to create the Calculator project.
<li>The GUI builder palette appears below the Java WorkShop main toolbar. All components you need to create the GUI for the calculator are available in these tabbed pages.
<li>A separate layout window opens, displaying a 12-cell grid. The cells help you position components (such as text buttons and labels) accurately within your application.
<li>Java WorkShop adds the Calculator project to the project manager.
</ul>
</ol>
