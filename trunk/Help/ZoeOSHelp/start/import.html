<h1>Adding Your Personal Portfolio</h1>

The first time you run Java Workshop, it creates a portfolio called "personal," for which you have write permission. If you remove your personal portfolio, but do not delete the portfolio (<kbd>.psf</kbd>) file from your file system, you can import it back into Java WorkShop.
<p>
Otherwise, for this tutorial, you can use any portfolio for which you have write permission. Or, you can create a new portfolio using the help in <a href="../manager/CreatePortfolio2.html">Creating a Portfolio</a>.
<p>
The following instructions describe how to add your personal portfolio:
<ol>
<li>In the Java WorkShop Project Manager window, choose File -> Add -> Portfolio.
<br>The Add Portfolio dialog box is displayed.
<li>Type <kbd>/<b>your_installation_directory</b>/jws/personal.psf</kbd> in the Portfolio file box.
<br>All portfolio file names end in the extension <kbd>.psf</kbd>.
<li>Click Add.
<br>Java WorkShop makes your personal portfolio the current portfolio and displays its name in blue text.
</ol>
