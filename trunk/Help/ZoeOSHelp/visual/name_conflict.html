<H1>Resolving Name Conflicts</H1>

Two components with the same name are not allowed to exist
in the same interface (the same <code>.gui</code> file). The Import
Resolution dialog box helps you change any conflicting names in
the incoming interface so that all names are unique once the
imported interface is merged with the current interface.
<p>
The Import Resolution dialog box is automatically activated when a
file you are trying to import (or merge) contains one or more
components with names that are the same as ones already in your GUI.
<p>
Use the Back and Next buttons to cycle through all of the components
that have conflicting names. For each conflict you have
GUI builder automatically generates a unique name for you, or you can
specify a unique name yourself.
