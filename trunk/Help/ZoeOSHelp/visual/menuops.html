<H1>Adding Operations to Menus</H1> 

Before adding operations to menu items, save your layout and generate
a <i>project</i><tt>.gui</tt> file. To generate Java code for
your layout, choose GUI -> Save Generate GUI File.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the container in the layout window and open the attribute
editor for the container(right click in the area outside the grid).
<li>In the Layout window, select a menu item.
<p>
When a menu item is selected, the content of the attribute
editor changes to display attributes for a menu item.
<li>Click on the Edit operations button.
<p>
The ID for the menu item is displayed in the labeled bar at the top of
the Operations dialog box. 
<li>Click on the Insert button to add an operation (GUI builder
provides a default name, Ops<i>number</i>, for the operation; you can
rename the operation by typing a name in the Op Name box).
<p>
Use the Delete button to remove operations from the list.  
If you accidentally delete operations, you can click Reset
to return the list to its state after the last Apply
operation. There is no undo operation; you cannot reverse changes you
have applied. 
<li>Click on the Filter button to set the triggering event, either an
event filter or a message filter.
<p> 
Filters are described in <A HREF="ops.html#filtertypes">Filters</A>.
<li>Click the Action button and set the desired response to the
trigger by selecting an action type. 
<p>
Actions are described in <A HREF="ops.html#actiontypes">Actions</A>.
</ol>

<br>
As you add more filters and actions, you can test them
in the layout window.  Custom actions added in the
Action dialog box are available only when running the
application.
<p>
Save the operation settings by clicking OK in the Operations dialog
box. When you are ready to test the application, choose GUI
-> Save Generate GUI File to create or update the
<tt>.gui</tt> file. Then build the application, and click the Run
button in the Java WorkShop toolbar.
