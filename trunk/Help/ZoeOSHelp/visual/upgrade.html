<h1>Updating a Bean</h1>

Using the GUI builder, you can update a bean in two ways:

<ul>
<li>Manually. By choosing  GUI -> Update Component Classes in
Design, you can select the specific bean classes to update.
<li>Automatically. By importing a bean to the
palette. With automatic updating, all bean classes in the JAR are updated.
</ul>

bean:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Choose GUI -> Update Component Classes in Design.
<li>Select the bean class or classes you want to update from the list. 
<li>Click the Update button.
<p>
After you click Update, the project directory is updated with the new
bean classes; however, the instance of the bean in the layout is not
updated. A pop-up window appears, warning you that you now have an
instance of the bean in the layout that is older than the version now
recognized in the project:
<ul>
<li>You can update the bean in the layout by clicking Reload Design. 
<li>You can leave the bean as is by clicking Cancel.  
</ul>
</ol>

<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To automatically update a bean:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Import a version of an existing bean into the GUI builder
palette.  
<p>
A dialog box warns you that an update has
been detected. It displays the bean classes that will be updated.
<li>Click Import and Upgrade.
<p>
All the bean classes shown in the list are automatically updated. The project
directory now contains the modified JAR file for the latest instance of the
bean and the palette contains that version of the bean. The bean in
the layout has not been updated yet. 
<p>
After the import and update has taken place, the Reload Design After
Update dialog box appears.
<li>Click Reload Design to update the bean in the layout. Now your
layout contains the newest version of the bean. Build the
application to test the latest instance of the bean.
</ol>
