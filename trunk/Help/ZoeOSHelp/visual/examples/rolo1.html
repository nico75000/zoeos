Making Your Own Card File
</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">


<H1>Making Your Own Card File</H1>

In this example, a simple standalone card file application is
designed. Ultimately, the card file will contain:
<ul>
<li>Three text boxes with labels:  Name, Phone, and Email
<li>An Add button to add the information in the text boxes to the
scrolling list
<li>A Find button to display the name specified in the Name text field
<li>A labeled scrolling list text box to display names and phone numbers
<li>A Delete button to remove the selected name from the card file
</ul>

When all the components have been added to the layout, your card file
should look like this:
<a name=cardfile_gif></a>
<pre>
<img src="../../../images/visual/examples/cardfile.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=360>
</pre>

<h2>Select the Right Container</h2>
<p>
Since the application being built is meant to run outside of a
browser, the main container should be a frame instead of a panel.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To change container
type from Panel (the default) to Frame:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Choose GUI -> Set Window Type.
<li>In the Main Container dialog box, select the untitled panel and
click Frame. 
<li>Click OK to establish the change.
</ol>

<h2>Modify the Gridbag</h2>

The gridbag layout panel should have a 6 (rows) by 4 (columns) grid.
<pre>
<img src="../../../images/visual/examples/grid_panel1.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=181>
</pre>

To add a row, click on a corner square and press the Up Arrow or
Down Arrow key.
<p>
To delete a column, click on a corner square and press the
Delete key.
<p>
For detailed information on changing the grid, see <a
href="../layout.html#create_layoutgrid">Create a Layout Grid</a>. 


<h2>Add the Components</h2>

You will need to add the following components:

<ul>
<li>Text Label (3)</li>
<li>Single-line TextField (3)</li>
<li>Text Button (3)</li>
<li>List (1)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To add a component:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Click on a component in the GUI builder palette. 
<li>Click on a cell in the gridbag.
</ol>
<p>
For details on adding, modifying, and deleting components from the
gridbag, see <a href="../layout.html#addcomps">Add Components to the
Layout Grid</a>.
<p>
Once all the components have been added, save the file.

<h3>Label Text Fields and Buttons</h3>

The next step in creating the card file is to label the text fields and
buttons. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To add labels to the buttons:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select a button component.
<li>Open the attribute editor by clicking on its button in the main toolbar.
<li>Apply the label for the button by typing its name in the text box.
</ol>

<p>
Although Gui builder provides a unique name for each component
added to the layout, the names are generic and indistinguishable (for
example, button1, button2, ...). You should assign unique
IDs to the components to ensure that behavior is added to
the correct component. For example, the following component IDs were
made for the card file:

<dl>
<dd>Replaced the <tt>textfield1</tt> ID with <tt>nameTextfield</tt>.
<dd>Replaced the <tt>textfield2</tt> ID with <tt>phoneTextfield</tt>.
<dd>Replaced the <tt>textfield3</tt> ID with <tt>emailTextfield</tt>.
<dd>Replaced the <tt>button1</tt> ID with <tt>addButton</tt>.
<dd>Replaced the <tt>button2</tt> ID with <tt>findButton</tt>.
<dd>Replaced the <tt>list1</tt> ID with <tt>namesList</tt>.
<dd>Replaced the <tt>button3</tt> ID with <tt>deleteButton</tt>.
</dl>
<p>
You will see these component IDs in the Adding Behavior to the Card
File section.

<h2>Preview the Card File</h2>

Preview the card file GUI by choosing Preview from the Mode
list. The Mode list is located to the right of the palette.

<h2>Generate Java Code</h2>

Once the card file layout is complete, you need to generate the Java
source file for the layout:

<ol>
<li>Select the frame by clicking in the area around the GUI layout in
the layout window.
<li>Choose GUI -> Save Generate GUI File.
<li>Check your <i>project</i> directory for a
<tt>.gui</tt> file. 
</ol>

Now you are ready to add <a href=rolo2.html>behavior</a> to the components.
