<h1>Tips on Using Beans Effectively</h1>

Since JDE is becoming a bean-based tool there are things you
should do when you are designing applications or applets in the
current version of JDE.
<p>
For highlights on groups and shadows, generated code, and events, see
<a href="groupShadow-background.html">A Groups and Shadows Quick Start
Guide</a>.

<h2>Customizing Component Properties</h2>

When you want to set or get a component property programmatically, you
should code directly to the shadow's underlying AWT component or bean
(the body) by using the <tt>getBody</tt> method.
<p>
Here is an example of how to set the label on an AWT component, such
as a button:

<pre>
     Button myButtonBody=(Button)gui.myButton.getBody();
     myButtonBody.setLabel("New Button Label");
     String theLabel=myButtonBody.getLabel();
</pre>

Here is an example of how to call a method on a bean. In this example
the bean is called <tt>Pinto</tt>.

<pre>
     Pinto myPintoBody=(Pinto)gui.myPinto.getBody();
     myPintoBody.createBurrito("Hot sauce");
</pre>

<h2>Adding Operations to AWT Components and Beans</h2>

You can add events to components and beans in the following ways:

<ul>                    
<li>If you want to use 1.0 events on AWT components, use the
<a href="addcallbacks.html">Operations dialog box</a>.  

<li>If you are adding behavior to beans in your application or applet, you
should hook up behavior using listeners. You can add listeners in the
<tt>createGroup</tt> method in the application's Group file. For example:

<pre>
   public class Button extends Group implements ActionListener {
     ...
     private Button myButtonBody;
     public void createGroup() {
       myButtonBody=(Button)gui.myButton.getBody();
       myButtonBody.addActionListener(this);
     }

     public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
       if (e.target == myButtonBody) {
            // code to handle the event here
       } 
     }
   }
</pre>

<p>
As soon as you register a listener on a component, the operations you
defined for the same component using the Operations dialog box will
not operate. The reason is because the code generated for the
operations are in the JDK 1.0 style events.
</ul>

<p>
The Message filters in the Filter dialog box does not translate well
to the JDK 1.1 event style. You should use the JDK's event listener
mechanism to implement the equivalent functionality.

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

For an overview of how beans are created and used in JDE,
see <a href=jbeanstory.html>Beans in JDE</a>. The overview
discusses the bean cycle from the creation of JAR files to the
importation, the instantiation, and the updating of beans.

the Clock Project</a>.
