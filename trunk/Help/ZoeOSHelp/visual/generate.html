<H1>Generating Java Source Code</H1>

Once you have laid out your window, you must generate the
Java code that you will integrate with your program.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To generate code for your layout:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Choose GUI -> Save Generate GUI File.
</ul>

<p>
When you generate code, GUI builder automatically saves your
layout.
<p>
When you generate code from your layout, the following files are
generated in the project's source directory:
<p>
<strong><i>project</i><code>.gui</code></strong>
<br>
Contains the code that describes the GUI. This file is
updated (or created) whenever you save the layout. One
<code>.gui</code> file is generated per group. A Java
WorkShop project can contain only one group, but projects
can contain other projects.
<p>
<strong><i>project</i><code>Root.java</code></strong>
<br>
Contains the code necessary to initialize the components
for the group.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
Do not make changes to this file--it is
recreated every time you generate the interface.
<p>
<strong><i>project</i><code>Ops.java</code></strong>
<br>
Contains the operations for the group.  This file is
generated only if you have defined operations on one or
more of the components in the group.  Operations are described
in <A HREF="dialogs/operations.html">Operations Dialog Box</A>.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
Do not make changes to this file--it
is recreated every time you generate the
interface.
<p>
<strong><i>project</i><code>Main.java</code></strong>
<br>
Contains the main method that is used to run the group as
an applet or a standalone application.
<p>

<br>
Do not make changes to this file--it
is recreated every time you generate the
interface.

<p>
<strong><i>project</i><code>.java</code></strong>
<br>
Contains a template for the group.  This file is 
generated only once--you modify this file to implement event
handlers, action handlers, and other functionality.

<h2>Error Checking</h2>

During code generation, some error checking is done on the
<code>.gui</code> file.  The attribute types are checked for
correctness, and the attribute values are matched against the
attribute types.  However, the attribute types are not checked against
the attribute names.  Also, the attribute names are not checked
against the shadow or group inside which they are defined.
<p>
Errors of this nature are uncommon in a <code>.gui</code> file. This
kind of error could be introduced by hand-editing the
<code>.gui</code> file or by modifying the attributes of a shadow or
group class that is used by an existing <code>.gui</code> file.
<p>
These errors are not caught because the code generator does not load
any of the shadow or group classes listed in the <code>.gui</code>
file. It is much faster to generate the code without loading all the
shadows and groups, and not loading the groups avoids dependency
problems.
<p>
The code generator instantiates all the shadows and groups during
generation. Errors such as bad attribute names and attribute type
mismatches are caught. The generator will throw an error if one of the
group or shadow classes that it needs does not exist.
