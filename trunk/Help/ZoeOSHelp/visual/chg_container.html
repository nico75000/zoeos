<H1>Changing the Main Container Type</H1>

<ol>
<li>Choose GUI -> Set Window Type.
<li>Select the container you want to change in the Main Container list.
<li>Click on either the Frame or Panel radio button.
<li>Click OK to change to the new container type.
</ol>

You can change the type of a top-level container only. A top-level
container can be either a frame or a panel.

<p>
<strong>Panels</strong>
<br>
Panels are containers that do not create separate windows
of their own.  A panel should be used as the main container
for applets that display their GUIs in a browser page or
applet viewer.
<p>
<strong>Frames</strong>
<br>
Frames are top-level application windows with a title and a
border. A frame should be used as the main container for:
<ul>
<li>A standalone application
<li>An applet whose GUI exists outside of the browser,
not within the page
</ul>
Frames are the only types of containers to which you
can add menu bars.
