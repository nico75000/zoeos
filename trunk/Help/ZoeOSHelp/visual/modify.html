<H1>Modifying Components in the Grid</H1>

This section explains how to:

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#copy">Copy a component to another cell</A></li>
<li><A HREF="#delete">Delete a component</A></li>
<li><A HREF="#change">Change a component's attributes</A></li>
</ul>

<p>
<A NAME=copy></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To copy a component to another cell:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Select the component.
<li>Choose GUI -> Copy Component.
<li>Click in the cell in which you want to paste a copy of the
component.
<li>Choose GUI -> Paste Component.  
</ol>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
A shortcut to copying and pasting components is to select the
component then while holding the Control key down, click in the grid
cells where you want to place the component.

<p>
<A NAME=delete></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To delete a component:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select the component.
<li>Choose GUI -> Delete Component.
</ol>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
You can also choose GUI -> Cut Component to remove the
component and place it on the clipboard. Click on a cell
and choose GUI -> Paste Component to paste the component
into the selected cell. 

<p>
<A NAME=change></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To change a component's attributes:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Open the attribute editor by
selecting a component in the gridbag and clicking on its button in the
main toolbar.  
<br>
A shortcut method for opening the attribute editor is to
double-click while the cursor is positioned
in the area between the component and its cell border.
<li>Changes the values for the attributes you want to modify.
<li>Click OK to establish the changes.
</ol>

<p>
Component attributes vary, depending on the function of the component.
Not all characteristics of a component can be modified. The attribute
editor displays only those aspects of a component that you can
change. Specialized attributes are explained with the description of
their associated components; for a list of the palette components, see
<A HREF="palette.html">GUI Builder Palette</A>. General attributes
that apply to most of the components are described in <A
HREF="dialogs/attributes.html">Attribute Editor</A>.
<p>
For more details about component attributes, see the API documentation. 

<p>
<A NAME=changebean></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To customize a bean:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select a bean that you've placed in the gridbag.
<li>Open the attribute editor by clicking on its button in the main toolbar.
<li>Click the Customizer button to open the Customizer dialog box.
<li>Set the attributes you want to change (attributes displayed in the
dialog box are specific for the actual bean).
<li>Click OK to close the dialog box, then click OK in the attribute
editor to establish the changes.
</ol>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
You can modify a bean if the bean contains a customizer in its JAR
file. No action results if you click the Customizer button for a bean
without a customizer in its JAR file.
