<H1>Card File - Examples of Creating an Application</H1>

Card File is an extended example that highlights the
application construction features of the GUI builder. It also shows
you how to create your own component with GUI builder, how to add it
to the GUI palette, and how to use that component with the card file
application created earlier.
