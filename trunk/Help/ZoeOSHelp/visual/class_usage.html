<h1>Checking Class Usage</h1>

If you ever want to check which classes are currently in use in a
project, you can review a generated list of classes (and their source
paths). This information is particularly useful when you are ready to
deploy your application or applet.

<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To see what classes are
used in the current GUI project</strong>: 
<ul>
<li>Choose GUI -> Class Usage Report. A dialog box opens
displaying a list of class names and sources.
</ul>

To see specific information about a bean, see <a
