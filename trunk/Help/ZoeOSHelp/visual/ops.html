<H1>What Is a Component Operation?</H1>

When you add a behavior to a component, you are defining an operation
for it. The term "operation" refers to specialized callbacks that you
can define using the GUI builder Operations dialog box. Callbacks are
typically implemented by adding custom code to the Group file
(<i>project</i><tt>.java</tt>).
<p>
This section covers: 

<ul>
<li><a href=#callbacks>Operations</a>
<li><a href=#filtertypes>Filters</a>
<li><a href=#actiontypes>Actions</a>
</ul>

For instructions on adding a specific behavior to a component,
see <a href=addcallbacks.html>Adding Operations to Components</a>.

<a name=callbacks></a>
<h2>Operations</h2>

Operations can be implemented by adding custom code to the Ops file
through the Operations dialog box. However, code added to the Ops file
should be kept to a minimum as that code can be overwritten when the
file is regenerated. A better method is to add minimal lines of code
to the Ops file (for example, a single line that calls an operation)
and add the main body of code to the Group file (the
<i>project</i><tt>.java</tt> file).
<p>
In many cases, you can go through the Operations dialog box to use
predefined GUI builder operations, which might automate all of the
code generation. Another way to add operations is to edit the group
file directly through the source editor.
<p>
An operation consists of two parts: 
<ul>
<li>A <em>filter</em> that defines when an action happens (the cause)
<li>An <em>action</em> that defines what the action is (the effect)
</ul>

For example, consider an operation that shows a window when the user
clicks a button. The operation is defined for the button with a filter
of Action Event (the button is pressed) and an action of Show Window.

<a name=matchevents></a>
<p>
You must associate operations with a specific component. An operation
is usually triggered by events and messages that originate from its
associated component. More than one operation can be defined for each
component. If two operations match the same event, the operation that
is closer to the beginning of the list is called first.

<a name=filtertypes></a>
<h2>Filters</h2>

There are two different types of filters: <em>event filters</em> and
<em>message filters</em>. An event filter is triggered by AWT events, and
a message filter is triggered by messages from other groups.  The target
for these messages must match the component or group for which the
operation is being defined. 
<p>
For information on new-style and old-style event handling, see the JDK
documentation, <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/awt/designspec/events.html">"Java
AWT: Delegation Event Model</a>." (You may have to reset the proxies
on the Java Workshop help browser if you have difficulties reaching
the Delegation Event Model.)
<p>
For a demonstration of how to use the new style 1.1 events, see 
<p>

<a name=eventfilter</a>
<h3>Event Filter</h3>

There are many event filters that can be defined for an action. Some
examples are Mouse Down, Key Press, and Action Event. An event
filter is used to select particular types of AWT events for which an
action should be called (see the JDK documentation of the AWT Event
class for more details).
<p>
An event filter has four parameters: 
<ul>
<li>Id
<li>Key
<li>Modifier
<li>Click Count
</ul>

The only required element is the Id. The Event Id determines the type
of event for the filter. The Key, Modifier, and Click Count fields
are used to further narrow the scope of the filter for a given Event
Id.
<p>

For example, the set of events selected by the Key Press Event Id
can be further narrowed by specifying the key, <tt>C</tt>.  The event
filter can be narrowed even further by specifying the modifier
<tt>Control</tt>. The event filter, Key Press, will be triggered when
the operation's component is selected and the user presses
<tt>Control-C</tt>.

<p> 
The types of modifiers available depend on the Event Id.  For
key events, the modifiers are:
<ul>
<li>Shift
<li>Control
<li>Meta
<li>Alt
</ul>  
For mouse events, the modifiers are:
<ul>
<li>Left Mouse
<li>Middle Mouse
<li>Right Mouse
</ul>
<p> 
The Click Count is important only for mouse events.  To catch a
double-click, the Event Id is Mouse Down, the Modifier is Left
Mouse, and the Click Count is 2.

<a name=messfilter></a>
<h3>Message Filter</h3>

Currently, GUI builder, does not automatically generate messages.
You must write the code that generates a message. You can use the
Operations dialog box to specify incoming messages and the actions
that they trigger when they are received.

<p>
A message filter has three parts: 
<ul>
<li>Name
<li>Type
<li>Target Name
</ul>

Each of these parts is a string that is matched against any messages
that are received. You must specify the message Name, but the Type and
Target Name fields can be left blank. The Type and Target Name are
additional filters within the scope of the message name. Note that the
target object is always searched for and must match the Target Name if
a Target Name is supplied.

<p>
The component for which the operation is defined must be the target of
the message (if the target is defined), or the filter will not be
triggered. For example, you might have a custom subgroup that sends
out "Apply" messages.  To trigger off of the "Apply" message, you should
select the group and then edit its <tt>operations</tt> attribute. Then define
an operation that has a message filter with the name
"Apply." Optionally, you can define the target to be the group.


<A NAME=actiontypes></A>
<H2>Actions</H2>

An operation's action determines what happens when there is a matching
event. GUI builder specifically supports some common actions, such as
showing and hiding a component, exiting the application, and setting
an attribute on a component. You can specify custom code that is
called when the action is triggered. 

<p>
Common actions and custom code actions are not treated in quite the
same way.  Common actions are live both while the application is
running and while you are building the application. Custom code
actions are live only while the program is running. Future versions of
GUI builder may support live code actions while building the
application.

<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
The exit action is not live while building the application because it
would cause GUI builder to exit and unsaved changes would be lost.

<h3>Action Types</h3>
Choose one of the following action types from the Action
Type menu:
<ul>
<li>Show
<li>Hide
<li>Exit
<li>Set Attribute
<li>Execute Code
</ul>

<h4>Show, Hide</h4> 

After you choose one of these actions from the menu, you must select a
target for the action from the Target pane. The target is the
component that will be shown or hidden when the action is invoked.

<h4>Exit</h4>

There is no target for the exit action.

<h4>Set Attribute</h4>

If you choose Set Attribute, you must:
<ol>
<li>Select a component from the Target pane and an
attribute of that component from the Name pane.
<li>Choose either Constant or Event Arg from the Value Source menu.
<p>If you choose Constant, you can
statically set the value using the provided windows, text boxes, and so on.
<p>
If you choose Event Arg, the event argument must be the same type as the
attribute that you have selected. For example, checkboxes have
Boolean event arguments. The <tt>enabled</tt> attribute defined for components
is also a Boolean value. Therefore, you can legally choose the Event Arg
option for the checkbox as long as you select the <tt>enabled</tt> attribute
for the target component. Defining an action this way causes the
checkbox to toggle the component between the enabled and disabled
states.
</ol>

<A NAME=CustomCode></A>
<h4>Execute Code</h4>

If you choose Execute Code from the Action Type menu, a text
box is available for you to enter code. You can enter custom
operations that are automatically included in your application.
<p>
The code you enter in the Execute Code box is saved in the
<code>.gui</code> file, and is later generated into the
<em>project-name</em><code>Ops.java</code> file.
<p>
The preferred method is to write custom code as individual handlers in
the group file (the <i>project</i><tt>.java</tt> file). Then invoke
the handler from the Execute Code box. For example, in the Execute
Code box you call:
<pre>
group.myActionHandler();
</pre>
In the group file, you define the operation:
<pre>
public void myActionHandler(){
       ...
}
</pre>

<h4>Special Variables</h4>

There are several important variables that are available
within the scope of the custom code segment.
<p>
For a group named <code>MyProg</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>MyProg group;</code>
<br>
Group variable.  The group is guaranteed to be
initialized when the action is invoked.
<p>
<li><code>MyProgRoot gui;</code>
<br>
  Root variable.  The root will be non-null when the action
  is invoked.
<p>
<li><code>Message msg;</code>
<br>
  The message that triggered the action.  The message will
  always be non-null.
<p>
<li><code>Event evt;</code>
<br>
  AWT event that triggered the action.  This will be null
  only if the triggering message is not an AWT event.  This
  can happen if the operation is using a message filter
  instead of an event filter.
<p>
For more information on message handling and AWT events, see 
<a href=groups_basic.html#awtmsghandling>Message Handling
(Operations)</a>.
</ul>
<p>

The following is a code segment that shows the window
<tt>frame1</tt> when a button is clicked:
<pre>
  gui.frame1.set("visible", Boolean.TRUE);
</pre>
<p>
The following is a code segment that shows or hides the window
<tt>frame1</tt> depending on the state of a checkbox:
<pre>
  gui.frame1.set("visible", evt.arg);
</pre>

<a name=importstatement></a>
<h4>Import Statements</h4>

You can add import statements at the top of your custom
code. The code generator will place them in the correct
location in the generated sources.  For example, if you
type:
<pre>
  import java.net.*;
  URL url = new URL(gui.urlTF.get("text"));
  URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();

</pre>
the following code is generated into the
<em>project-name</em><code>Ops.java</code> file.
Note the position of the import statement.
<pre>
  import java.io.net.*;
  private void handleCallback(int index, Message msg, Event evt) {
    switch (index) {
    case 1:
      {
group.exit();
      }
      break;
    case 2:
      {
URL url = new URL(gui.urlTF.get("text"));
URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
      }
     }
  }

</pre>
<br>
<A NAME=GetBody></A>
<h4>Accessing AWT Methods for Shadows Classes</h4>
The <code>getBody()</code> call allows you to access
methods of the classes on which shadow classes are based.
For example, if you want to determine which item is
selected in a <code>ListShadow</code> object, type:

<pre>
  String string_selected=((List) listShadow.getBody()).getSelectedItem();
</pre>

<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13">
<br>
To access the methods, you must cast the result of the <tt>getBody</tt> call.
<p>
You can use either the shadow class for the <code>get()</code> and
<code>set()</code> methods or the <code>getBody()</code> method, which
accesses the AWT component directly. The shadow class methods utilize
workarounds and optimizations. For example:

<pre>
String string_selected=listShadow.get("selectedItem");
</pre>

<a name=accessapples></a>
<h4>Accessing the Applet</h4>

The <code>group</code> class provides a method for
accessing the applet. For example, if in your operation
you need to access a parameter supplied to the applet (in
this case the blink rate), type:
<pre>
 Applet ap = getApplet();
 String param = ap.getParameter("blinkrate");
</pre>
