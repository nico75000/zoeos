<h1>Quick Start on Groups and Shadows</h1>

The groups and shadows framework provides a component mechanism that 
allows the Java WorkShop GUI builder to import and manipulate
components.

<h2>Shadows</h2>

A shadow class is a wrapper around an AWT component or bean.  The
wrapped object is called the body, and you access it by using the
<tt>getBody()</tt> method. The shadow provides an API for accessing
the attributes of the body using the <tt>get</tt> and <tt>set</tt>
methods. The body's methods are also available and can be used
directly instead of the shadow's accessors.

<h3>Getting the Component Body From the Shadow</h3>

In the Group and Ops files there is a variable <tt>gui</tt> that is an
instance of the application's Root class, which is the root of the
hierarchy of shadow instances for the application's graphical user
interface. When you set the name of the component using the attribute
editor, that name is available as a data member of the Root class, and
contains the shadow instance rather than the component itself. To get
the AWT component or bean that the shadow is wrapping, use the
<tt>getBody</tt> method, and cast it to the appropriate class.

<h2>Groups</h2>

Groups provide a mechanism for creating interchangeable components
that can be plugged together using GUI builder or by programmatic
means. 

<h3>Customizing Application Startup</h3>

The file you edit to add your own code is the Group file
(<em>project</em><tt>.java</tt>). The Main file contains the entry
pint methods for the application or applet. You cannot edit the Main
file; if you need to customize some of the startup behavior of your
application, there are hooks provided in the group class to do so.

<a name=groupmethods></a>
<p>
There are several methods in the Group file that are called during
the startup sequence. Overriding these methods allows you to have
code executed at the appropriate time.

<p>
<table>
<tr valign=top>
<td>
<tt>initGroup</tt> 
</td>
<td>
Called after the shadow tree is created. At this point all
the shadows are available, but the AWT component bodies and beans have
not been created yet. You can get and set properties on the shadows
using the <tt>get</tt> and <tt>set</tt> methods.
<p>
This method is called only once during the lifetime of a group.
Usually, you do not need to put any code in this method. 
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>
<tt>createGroup</tt> 
</td>
<td>
Called when the group's AWT component bodies are created which
happens the first time the group is made visible or when the group's
<tt>create</tt> method is called explicitly.
<p>
This method should contain any code that is needed when the AWT
components or bean bodies are initialized.
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>
<tt>destroyGroup</tt> 
</td>
<td>
Called when the group is destroyed and the AWT component hierarchy
is destroyed. The shadow hierarchy is not destroyed.
<p>
This method should contain code that cleans up data structures created
in the <tt>createGroup</tt> method.
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>
<tt>showGroup</tt><br>
<tt>hideGroup</tt>
<td>
Called when the group is made visible or invisible. 
<p>
These methods should contain code that is related to groups becoming
visible or invisible.
</tr>
</table>

The generated Group file has comments that explain each of these
methods in more detail.

<h2>Overview of the Generated Files</h2>

Currently, GUI builder generates four files that are compiled into
the application: 

<ul>
<li><i>project</i><tt>Root.java</tt> (the Root file) contains the code
that creates the component tree, sets properties and layout
information.

<li><i>project</i><tt>Ops.java</tt> (the Ops file) contains the
operations and event handler code.

<li><i>project</i><tt>Main.java</tt> (the Main file) contains the
application (or applet) subclass and the <tt>main()</tt> routine for
calling the application in a standalone mode.
 
<li><i>project</i><tt>.java</tt> (the Group file) glues it all together,
and is where the GUI programmer puts custom initialization code and
other methods needed by the application.
</ul>

<a name=eventtips></a>
<h2>Events</h2>

Java WorkShop supports both JDK 1.0 and JDK 1.1 style events.  You can
mix both types in your application. However, you can use only one
style for a given component. Specifically, if you add event listeners
to a component, the JDK 1.0 style events no longer propagate.

<h3>Filters</h3>

GUI builder provides a mechanism for filtering JDK 1.0 style events on
AWT components using the Filters dialog box. This dialog box allows you
to specify which events an operation responds to.

<h3>Actions</h3>

The Actions dialog box supports several action types.      
The Show, Hide, Set Property, and Exit actions perform simple
operations without your having to write any code. The Execute Code
actions allow you to customize the operation by writing a small amount
of code. 
<p>
The Actions dialog box shows a text field in which you write code
fragments. This code is generated into the Ops file. There are two
variables, <tt>group</tt> and <tt>gui</tt>, available in the scope of
this code fragment. A simple way to use this mechanism is to declare a
public method in the group class and call it in the code fragment.
<p>
For example, you can put a method in your group class:

<pre>
 public void doSomething() {
   // do something
 }
</pre>
and then call it from the dialog box:
<pre>
 group.doSomething();
</pre>
