<h2>Some Basics</h2>
This section describes how you start GUI builder, add and delete
cells in the layout grid, and add components to the grid.

<h3>Start GUI Builder</h3> 

To create an application with GUI builder, you must first create a GUI
project. Choose Project -> New and use the project
wizard to create a GUI project. When you have created the project, the
GUI builder panel is displayed between the Java WorkShop main toolbar
and the Edit/Debug toolbar. The panel displays the component palette,
name of the current container, the current mode state (Edit or
Preview), and the name of the selected component.
<p>
When GUI builder starts, a separate layout window opens with a default
panel container. The layout window displays a gridbag layout.
GUI builder uses a grid system that enables you to
place GUI components, such as buttons and text fields, in
the <em>cells</em> of a grid.  You can nest grids within the
cells of other grids using the <A
HREF="../visual/nest_panels.html">Gridbag Layout Panel</A> component.
<p>
At any time during the layout process, you can view a close
approximation of how the layout will look in your
application by switching the GUI builder mode from
Edit to Preview.

<h3>Create the Layout</h3>

When you start a new layout, a 12-cell grid is positioned in the
layout window.You can create a grid with as many cells as you need by
clicking in any cell and pressing on the arrow keys. A row or column
of cells is added to the grid in the direction of the arrow key each
time you press it.
<p>
Delete empty rows and columns from the grid by selecting them and pressing
the Delete key. The row and column containing the selected cell will
be deleted (you cannot delete individual cells). To delete a row or
column that contains a component, you must first delete the component.

<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To add components to the layout
grid:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Click on a component in one of the palette folders to select it.
<li>Click in the cell where you want to place the component.
</ol>

<p> 
<A NAME=addinvbeans></A> 
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To add an invisible bean
to the layout grid:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Click on an invisible bean in the palette.
<p>
Because the bean has no visible representation, it cannot be viewed in
the layout. To verify that you have added the invisible bean, check
the Windows list to the right of the palette. Each time an invisible
bean is selected, it's name is added to the Windows choice list. The
attribute editor for the invisible bean should also appear each time
the bean is selected.
</ul>

<p>
<A NAME=continue_cells></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To add a component to more than one cell:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Click on the component in the palette folder.
<li>Press the Control key.
<li>Click in the cells in which you want to add the component.
</ol>

<p>
Once you have placed a component in a cell, you can adjust its size
and location in the grid. To resize a component, see <a
href="resize.html">Resizing a Component</a>. To set the resizing
behavior of individual components with respect to the resizing of the
window that contains them, see <a href="wdw-resize.html">Resizing the
Layout</a>. To stretch components across cells, delete components, or
change their attributes, see <a href=modify.html>Modifying Components
in a Grid</a>.

See <a href="../visual/palette.html">GUI Builder Palette</a> for
information about components in the GUI builder palette.
