<h1>Beans in JDE</h1>

JavaBeans are reusable software components that you can use to create
applications or applets with the JDE GUI builder. They can
be elemental, such as a text box or label, or they can be complex,
such as a mail tool or a data inspector. Beans typically have a set
of properties, methods, and events. These properties are discovered by
the GUI builder at design time.
<p>
The following diagram demonstrates the process a bean goes through in
JDE:

<p>
There are two aspects to beans in JDE: the <em>producer</em>
side and the <em>consumer</em> side. On the producer side is the
creation of beans (that you would either use yourself or make
available for others). On the consumer side, is the import, use,
and update of the beans in your application or applet. These beans
could be ones that you created or acquired.

<h2>Creating a Bean</h2>

JDE has a project type called <tt>beans project</tt>.  You
create a bean project by using the Create Project wizard. A template
is provided in the source editor to help you construct the bean. When
you create a bean project in JDE, a JAR (Java Archive) file
is automatically generated when the project is built and it is stored
in the beans project directory.
<p>
A JAR file can contain files for multiple beans. Each bean and its
dependencies should be packaged in a separate JAR file.  This is
because each JAR file is used in the application/applet as a whole;
JDE does not unpack the JAR file. The JAR file is not
unpacked since there is no way to determine the runtime dependencies
of each bean. For instance, if you have multiple beans in a JAR file
but you need only one, you have the overhead of loading the unused
beans in the JAR file along with the one you want. After the JAR file
is created, you can import the bean into the GUI builder component
palette.
<p>

For detailed information on the JAR format, read <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/jar/index.html">JAR
- Java Archive</a>.
You may have to reset the proxies on the Java Workshop help browser if
you have difficulties reaching the Java Archive discussion.

<h2>Importing a Bean</h2>

On the production side, a bean is created and a JAR file is
generated. (The GUI builder can only import beans that are packaged in
JARs.) Once the bean exists, it is ready to be used (consumed). You
must first import the bean to the component palette. From the
component palette, you can select a bean to add to your GUI
design. Later on, you can reimport a another version of the same
bean to the component palette and update the project to use the other
version.
<p>
You can import the bean into the GUI builder component palette by
choosing GUI -> Import Component to Palette. When you
import a bean, its JAR file is modified: shadow classes are
automatically generated and added to the JAR file. This modified JAR
file is copied to the components library (the component palette is the
visual representation of the components library).  The source files
for generated shadow classes are stored in the same directory. Only
import by copying is supported at this time. Support for import by
reference will be available in a future release.
<p>
The components library is located at
<p>
On Solaris:
<br>
<tt>$HOME/.jws2.0/ImportedComponents</tt> directory
<p>
On Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT:
<br>
<tt>%HOME%\jws20\ImportedComponents</tt> directory

<h2>Instantiating a Bean</h2>
<p>
Once a bean is added to the component palette, it can be used in the
GUI design. Invisible beans are supported and can be added to the
component palette. They do not have a visible representation in the
design. Clicking on an invisible bean in the component palette adds it
to the design (the attribute editor opens for the bean verifying its
selection.  
<p> 
All the JAR files containing the beans used in the design are copied
to the project directory. Usage by copy is supported
in the current release; usage by reference will be supported in a
future release.  Once a bean has been added to the design, you can
customize the instance of a bean through the attribute editor or the
bean's customizer, if present. However, if a property editor is
provided with a bean, GUI builder does not invoke it. When a
customizer is provided, the bean customization information is
serialized. Serialization and deserialization is handled automatically by
the generated application for you.
<p>
You can add behavior visually with the Operations dialog box, which
allows you to add behavior quickly with minimal to no manual coding. Code
generated for the operations are in the JDK 1.0.2 propagation-style
events. To use new-style event handling, you must implement the code
manually.
<p>
When you add operations to a bean using the Operations dialog box, the
events fired by the bean do not show up on the list of event
filters. To register listeners for those events, you must manually add
code.  As an aide in adding operations to a bean, you can bring up the
Bean Information dialog box to get specific information about a bean's
properties, events, and methods. For an example of registering listeners,
see <a href="addcallbacks.html#addbeanops">Adding Operations to Beans</a>.
<p>
When you finish your layout, save it and generate the <tt>.java</tt>
files (choose GUI -> Save Generate GUI File). You
can then build and test your application or applet.
<p>
When you are ready to deploy the application or applet, you can find
out what classes are being used in a project by looking at the Class
Usage Report. This dialog box lists all the classes and their sources
for all components in the project. You need to copy these files along
with your application or applet to the location from which the 
application or applet is deployed.

<h2>Updating a Bean</h2>

When you need to update the beans in your design to a different
version of those beans, you can perform either an automatic or manual
update:
<ul>
<li>An automatic update of a bean occurs when you import different
versions of the beans being used in the current project. Conflicts are
automatically detected and you are notified that the instances in
the current project will be updated to the reimported versions of the beans.  
<li>When you manually update one or more beans in your project, you
update the beans in the project to the version that are in the
components library (this is assuming that you have reimported
different versions of the beans to the components library). You can
choose which beans to update from the Update Component Classes in
Design dialog box.
</ul>
<p>
The updated beans are not reflected in your design until you reload
the design. For both types of updates, a dialog box appears asking if
you want to reload the design.
<p>

beans in JDE, see, <a
