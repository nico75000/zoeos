<h1>Customizing a Bean</h1>

In the GUI builder, you can customize a bean through the
attribute editor or through the bean's customizer (if the bean has a
customizer).

attribute editor:</strong>

<li>Double-click the bean in the layout window to open the attribute editor.

the changes. If the bean has a customizer, proceed to the next step to
