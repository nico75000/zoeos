<H1>Action Editor</H1>

The action part of an operation determines what happens
when there is a matching event. GUI builder specifically
supports some common actions, such as showing and hiding
a component, exiting the application, and setting an
attribute on a component.  You can also specify custom code
that is executed when the action is invoked.
<p>
Common actions and custom code actions are not treated in
quite the same way. Common actions are live both while the
application is running and while you are building the
application. Custom code actions are live only while the
program is running. Future versions of GUI builder might support
live code actions while building the application.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../../images/hg_note.gif">
<br>
The exit action is not live while building the application because it
would cause GUI builder to exit and unsaved changes would be lost.

<h2>Action Types</h2>

Choose one of the following action types from the Action
Type menu:
<ul>
<li>Show
<li>Hide
<li>Exit
<li>Set Attribute
<li>Execute Code
</ul>

<h3>Show, Hide</h3> 

After you choose one of these actions from the menu, you
must select a target for the action from the Target display
pane.  The target is the component that is shown or
hidden when the action is invoked.

<h3>Exit</h3>

There is no target for the exit action.

<h3>Set Attribute</h3>

After you choose Set Attribute from the menu, you must:
<ol>
<li>Select a component from the Target pane and an
attribute of that component from the Name pane.
<li>Choose either Constant or Event Arg from the Value Source menu.
<p>If you choose the Constant from the menu, you can
statically set the value using the provided windows, text
boxes, and so on.
<p>
If you choose Event Arg from the menu, the event argument must be the
same type as the attribute that you have selected. For example,
checkboxes have Boolean event arguments. The <code>enabled</code>
attribute defined for components is also a Boolean value. Therefore, you
can legally choose the <code>event arg</code> option for the checkbox
as long as you select the <code>enabled</code> attribute for the
target component. Defining an action in this way causes the checkbox
to toggle the component between the enabled and disabled states.
</ol>

<A NAME=CustomCode></A>
<h2>Execute Code</h2>

If you choose the Execute Code item in the Action Type menu, a
text box is available for you to enter custom code.  You can create
custom callbacks that are automatically included in your application.
<p>
The code you enter in the Execute Code box is saved in the
<code>.gui</code> file, and is later generated into the
<em>project-name</em><code>Ops.java</code> file.

<h3>Special Variables</h3>

There are several important variables that are available
within the scope of the custom code segment.
<p>
For a group named <code>MyProg</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>MyProg group;</code>
<br>
Group variable. The group is guaranteed to be
initialized when the action is invoked.
<p>
<li><code>MyProgRoot gui;</code>
<br>
  Root variable. The root will be non-null when the action
  is invoked.
<p>
<li><code>Message msg;</code>
<br>
  The message that triggered the action. The message will
  always be non-null.
<p>
<li><code>Event evt;</code>
<br>
  AWT event that triggered the action. This will be null
  only if the triggering message is not an AWT event.  This
  can happen if the operation is using a message filter
  instead of an event filter.
</ul>
<p>

The following is a code segment that shows the window
<tt>frame1</tt> when a button is clicked:
<pre>
  gui.frame1.set("visible", Boolean.true);
</pre>
<p>
The following is a code segment that shows or hides the window
<tt>frame1</tt> depending on the state of a checkbox:
<pre>
  gui.frame1.set("visible", evt.arg);
</pre>

<h3>Import Statements</h3>

You can add import statements at the top of your custom code. The code
generator will place them in the correct location in the generated
sources. For example, if you type:
<pre>
  import java.net.*;
  URL url = new URL(gui.urlTF.get("text"));
  URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
</pre>
<p>
the following code is generated into the
<em>project-name</em><code>Ops.java</code> file. Note the
position of the import statement.
<pre>
  import java.io.net.*;
  private void handleCallback(int index, Message msg, Event evt) {
    switch (index) {
    case 1:
      {
group.exit();
      }
      break;
    case 2:
      {
URL url = new URL(gui.urlTF.get("text"));
URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
      }
     }
  }

</pre>
<br>

<A NAME=GetBody></A>
<h3>Accessing AWT Methods for Shadows Classes</h3> 

The <code>getBody()</code> call allows you to access methods of the
classes on which shadow classes are based. For example, if you want to
determine which item is selected in a <code>ListShadow</code> object,
type:

<pre>
  String string_selected=((List) listShadow.getBody()).getSelectedItem();
</pre>

In general, it is better to use the shadow class for the
<code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods rather than the
<code>getBody()</code> method which accesses the AWT component
directly. The shadow class methods utilize workarounds and
optimizations. For example:

<pre>
String string_selected=listShadow.get("selectedItem");
</pre>

<h3>Accessing the Applet</h3>

The <code>group</code> class provides a method for accessing the
applet. For example, if in your operation you need to access a
parameter supplied to the applet (in this case the blink rate), type:
<pre>
 Applet ap = getApplet();
 String param = ap.getParameter("blinkrate");
</pre>
