<H1>Filter Editor</H1>

There are two different types of filters: <em>event filters</em> and
<em>message filters</em>. An event filter triggers on AWT events, and
a message filter triggers on messages from other groups. The target
for these events and messages must match the component or group for
which the operation is being defined.

<h2>Event Filter</h2>

There are many different event filters that can be defined for an
action. Some examples are Mouse Press, Key Down, and Action
Event. An event filter is used to select particular types of AWT
events for which an action should be invoked (see the JDK
documentation of the AWT Event class for more details).
<p>
There are four aspects to an event filter: 
<ul>
<li>Id
<li>Key
<li>Modifier
<li>Click Count
</ul>
<p>
The only required element is the Id. The Id determines
the type of event for the filter. The Key, Modifiers, and Click Count
fields are used to further narrow the scope of the filter for a given
event Id.
<p>
For example, the set of events selected by the Key Down event Id can
be further narrowed by specifying a Key filter of C. This can be
narrowed even further by specifying the Modifier Control.  This filter
will be triggered when the operation's component has the keyboard
focus and the user presses Control+C.  
<p> 
Available modifiers depend on the event Id. For Key events, the
modifiers are: 
<ul>
<li>Shift
<li>Control
<li>Meta
<li>Alt
</ul>  
For mouse
events, the modifiers are:
<ul>
<li>Left Mouse
<li>Middle Mouse
<li>Right Mouse
</ul>
<p> 
The Click Count element is important only for mouse events.  To
catch a double-click, the event Id is "Mouse Down" and the Click Count
is 2.

<h2>Message Filter</h2>

With this version of GUI builder, messages are not automatically
generated, you must write the code that generates a message. You can
use the operations dialog box to specify incoming messages and the
actions that they trigger when they are received.
<p>
A message filter has three parts: 
<ul>
<li>Name 
<li>Type 
<li>Target Name 
</ul>
<p>
Each of these parts is a string that is matched against any messages
that are received. The message Name and Target Name must be specified,
but the Type can be left blank. The Type is an additional filter
within the scope of the message name. Note that the target object is
always searched for and must match the Target Name if a Target Name is
supplied.
<p>
The component for which the operation is defined must be the
originator of the message, or the filter will not be triggered. For
example, you might have a custom subgroup that sends out Apply
messages. To trigger off of the Apply message, you should select the
subgroup and then edit its operations attribute. Then define an
operation that has a message filter with the name Apply.
