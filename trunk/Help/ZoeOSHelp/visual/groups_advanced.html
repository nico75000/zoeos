<H1>More on Groups and Shadows</H1>

This is a continuation of the <A HREF="groups_basic.html"> groups and
shadows</A> discussion.

<h2>Groups</h2>

The primary purpose of GUI builder is to help you create groups. To
be considered a group, a class must be a subclass of the Group class.

<a name=writegrp></a>
<h3>Rules for Writing a Group</h3>

<ul>
<li>All attributes must be defined in the constructor. The helper methods
<CODE>addComponentAttributes</CODE>, <CODE>addFrameAttributes</CODE>,
and <CODE>addDialogAttributes</CODE> should be called in the
constructor to add a set of forwarded attributes to the group.

<li>In general, all attributes defined in the group should be handled
in method overrides of <CODE>getOnGroup</CODE> and
<CODE>setOnGroup</CODE>. Any attributes that are not handled should
be passed up using a call to super.

<p>
You may call <CODE>super.setOnGroup</CODE> with an attribute, even if 
the attribute is already being handled by your <CODE>setOnGroup</CODE> 
method. This will cause the attribute value to be stored in the
group's list of attributes. Then, the <CODE>getOnGroup</CODE> method
will automatically look up this attribute's value from the list. 

<p>
So make sure that any attributes that are handled in
<CODE>setOnGroup</CODE> without calling super are also handled in the
<CODE>getOnGroup</CODE> method. 

<li><CODE>initRoot</CODE> must be overridden to initialize the root of
the application.  The root contains all the children that are
contained by the group.  The default generated group contains an
<CODE>initRoot</CODE> method that does the right thing. 

<li>The <CODE>startGroup</CODE> and <CODE>stopGroup</CODE> methods can
be overridden to get notification when the applet starts and stops.
Also <CODE>startGroup</CODE> will be called when standalone
applications are completely done initializing. This can be useful if,
for example, you want to do something that may cause an error, and you
want to immediately display an error dialog box. 

<li>The <CODE>handleMessage</CODE> and <CODE>handleEvent</CODE>
methods should be overridden to receive AWT events from the root
children. For AWT events, the target of the message is the shadow
corresponding to the AWT component that sent the event. The target of
the AWT event is (of course) the AWT component itself.

<p>
For AWT components that do not have a shadow, the target of the
message will be set to the AWT component itself. 

<li>You need to be careful about delayed instantiation. The
<CODE>setOnGroup</CODE> and <CODE>getOnGroup</CODE> methods will not
be invoked until the group has been initialized. When the group is
initialized, <CODE>setOnGroup</CODE> will be invoked for all the
attributes. 

<p>
However, any custom methods that you write need to handle the case of
the group not being initialized or created. This is not a problem if
the user of the group is careful not to call the group's methods until
it is initialized-but better safe than sorry. Dealing with the group
not being initialized almost always consists of doing a null check on
the <CODE>gui</CODE> instance variable. 
</ul>

<h2>Shadows</h2>

To import a custom AWT component into the GUI builder's palette, you must
write a shadow class for it. GUI builder includes shadow classes for
all the standard AWT components.

<a name=writeshadow></a>
<h3>Rules for Writing a Shadow</h3>

<ul>
<li>All attributes must be declared in the constructor.  Attributes
should only be added or removed in the constructor.

<li>All attributes must be handled by the <CODE>getOnBody</CODE> and
<CODE>setOnBody</CODE> methods in the shadow class where they are
declared (attributes flagged with <CODE>NONBODY</CODE> are the
exception to this rule). 

<li><CODE>getOnBody</CODE> and <CODE>setOnBody</CODE> should invoke
super for all attributes that aren't handled in that particular shadow
class. 

<li>The default value of an attribute can be overridden by a shadow
class. Overriding the default value does require handling of the
attribute by the overriding shadow. The attribute can be handled by
the class in which it was originally declared. 

<li>In general, attributes do not need any flags. If you use an
attribute flag, be sure that you know what it does. 
</ul>

<p>
Both shadows and groups can be imported into the palette of GUI
builder. For information on how this can be done, see <A
HREF="ops.html#GetBody">Accessing AWT Methods for Shadows Classes</A>.

<a name=noshadow></a>
<h3>Putting AWT Components That Do Not Have a Shadow Inside a Group</h3>

If an AWT component does not have a shadow, add it as a child of an
existing panel or frame that is already inside the group. The events
from the AWT component will be delivered to the group. The message
target will be the same as the AWT event target. Normally the message
target is set to the shadow corresponding to the AWT event target, but
in this case there is no corresponding shadow.
<p>
Another method for adding an AWT component is to use the Generic
Component. The Generic Component is a special component that you can
use to import any custom AWT component class that you write. See <a
href=custom.html>Adding Custom Components and Windows</a> for a
discussion of Generic Component.

<h3>How to Use Groups Without the Generated Main</h3>

The following examples show how to use groups without the 
generated main.
<p>
<strong>Main</strong>
<pre>
  // Construct the group

  Group group = new MyFancyGroup();

  // Set the group environment.  The "args" are command 
  // line arguments.

  group.setEnvironmentInfo(null, args);

  // Initialize the group

  group.initialize();

  // Set the top level on the group

  WindowShadow win = (WindowShadow)group.getWindow();
  if (win instanceof FrameShadow) {
    win.createBody();
    group.setTopLevel((Frame)win.getBody());
  }
  else {
    group.setTopLevel(/* Pass in an existing frame window
			 from your application */);
  }

  // Create the group

  group.create();

  // If the group is a panel group, add it in the 
  // hierarchy somewhere

  if (group.getPanel() != null) {
    myApplicationFrame.add((Panel)group.getPanel().getBody());
  }

  // Start the group

  group.start();

</pre>
<p>
<strong>Applet</strong>
<pre>
  // Construct the group

  Group group = new MyFancyGroup();

  // Set the group environment.  The "applet" must be available here.

  group.setEnvironmentInfo(myApplet, null);

  // Initialize the group

  group.initialize();

  // Set the top level on the group

  WindowShadow win = (WindowShadow)group.getWindow();
  if (win instanceof FrameShadow) {
    win.createBody();
    group.setTopLevel((Frame)win.getBody());
  }
  else {
    // Figure out the applet's frame

    Component comp = applet;
    while (comp != null && !(comp instanceof Frame))
      comp = comp.getParent();
    group.setTopLevel((Frame)comp);
  }

  // Create the group

  group.create();

  // If the group is a panel group, add it in the 
  // hierarchy somewhere

  if (group.getPanel() != null) {
    myApplet.add((Panel)group.getPanel().getBody());
  }

</pre>
<p>
The start, stop, and destroy methods should be forwarded from the
applet to the group:
<pre>
  group.start();
  group.stop();
  group.destroy();
</pre>
