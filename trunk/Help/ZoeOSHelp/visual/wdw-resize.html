<H1>Resizing the Layout</H1>

You can determine how components will be resized when a user resize
the window or dialog box containing them. Depending on the controls
you set for a cell and the component contained in that cell, the
component can stretch with the window or not at all. You can also
constrain the resizing of a component to one direction only. There are
two aspects to resizing a component: enabling the cell containing the
component to stretch and enabling the component itself to
stretch. This section discusses:

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#cellsize">Changing cell height and width</A>
<li><A HREF="#resize-behavior">Controlling component resize behavior</A>
</ul>

<p>
To enlarge or shrink a component within a cell in the grid or to
expand a cell across a row or column, see <a
href="resize.html">Resizing a Component</a>.

<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To change cell height and width:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Click in a cell.
<pre>
<IMG SRC="../../images/visual/tcell_chg1.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=223>
</pre>
<p>
<li>Drag the handles of the cell height or width control on the right
or bottom of the layout window. 
<pre>
<IMG SRC="../../images/visual/tcell_chg2.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=224>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
The cell height control stretches the cell vertically. The cell width
control stretches the cell horizontally. If the cell contains a
component, the component is resized accordingly.
<p>
You can also use the width and height controls to reduce the size of a
stretched cell. (Each component has a minimum height and width, below
which you cannot resize.)

<h2>Controlling Component Resize Behavior</h2>

You can control component resizing behavior by using the row and column
controls in conjunction with the cell width and height controls.

<p>
<pre>
<IMG SRC="../../images/visual/trow-col.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=250>
</pre>
<p>
<p>
The lines on the left side of the layout window correspond to each row in
the grid; they are the row controls that enable you to control the
height of the individual rows. The lines on top of the layout window
correspond to each column in the grid; they are the column controls
that enable you to control the width of the individual columns.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To horizontally resize a component:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select the component.
<li>Click on the black bar in the cell width control. Arrowheads should
appear; the component will now fill the cell as the cell is resized.
<li>Click between the lines that correspond to the column that the
selected component is in. A black bar with arrowheads should appear and the
column width should double. The row will now stretch horizontally with
the window.
<pre>
<IMG SRC="../../images/visual/tresize1.gif" WIDTH=555 HEIGHT=361>
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
The preceding figure shows resizing behavior set for a Single-line
TextField component. Since only a single line of characters can be
displayed in this component, it does not make sense to allow the
component to resize vertically. You might try this procedure yourself
and view the layout in Preview mode. Try changing the size of the
layout window to see how the Single-line TextField changes.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><strong>To vertically resize a component:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select the component.
<li>Click on the black bar in the cell height control. Arrowheads should
appear; the component will now fill the cell as the cell is resized.
<li>Click between the lines that correspond to the row that the
selected component is in. A black bar with arrowheads should appear and the
row height should double. The row will now stretch vertically with
the window.
</ol>
<pre>
<IMG SRC="../../images/visual/tresize2.gif" WIDTH=555 HEIGHT=380>
</pre>
<p>
The preceding figure shows resizing behavior set for a Multi-line
TextField component. It is reasonable to allow this component to
resize both horizontally and vertically. Try previewing this layout
and see how resizing the layout window affects the multiline text.
<p>
The interaction between the row/column controls and the cell resizers
provides you with maximum flexibility in controlling resize behavior.
Try creating a small grid with a variety of components
and experiment with these controls.
