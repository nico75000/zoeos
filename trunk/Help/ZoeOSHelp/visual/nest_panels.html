<H1>Layout Managers and Nesting Panels</H1>

You can nest panels within cells using the following layout managers:
<ul>
<li><a href="#usegridpanel">Gridbag layout panel</a>. Enables you
to nest a layout panel inside an existing cell
<li><a href="#useflowpanel">Flow layout panel</a>. Enables you to
arrange components from left to right in rows, fitting as many
components in the row as possible before creating additional rows
<li><a href="#useborderpanel">Border layout panel</a>. Creates a
layout that lets you position grids in north, south, east, west
locations in the layout, and position another component in the
center (the center component receives all remaining space in the
panel)
</ul>

To create card panels or Tabbed Folders, see <a
href=../visual/tab_folder.html>Creating Tabbed Folders and Card Panels</a>.

<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><code><strong>items</strong></code></td>
<td>A dialog box that enables you to add and delete panels
from the flow layout panel and to change the names of those
panels.</td>
