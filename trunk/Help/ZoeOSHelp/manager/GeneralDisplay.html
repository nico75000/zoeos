<h1>General Tab</h1>

The General tab contains information about the project, including name, type, and source directory. If you change information in this tab, click the Apply button to enter the changes before moving to another tab.
<dl>
<dt><b>Project Name</b>
<dd>The name of the project.
<p>
<dt><b>Package Name</b>
<dd>Hierarchical name of the source. The Package Name box is displayed when either the Package or Beans project type is selected. For information on packages, see the <A HREF="packages.html">packages</A> write-up in the Java language specification.
<br>For example:
<p>
<code>/tmp/new/java/sun/jws/portfolio</code>
<p>
package name = <code>sun.jws.portfolio</code>
<p>
root directory = <code>/tmp/new/java</code>
<p>
<dt><b>Source Directory</b>
<dd>The directory that contains the source (<kbd>.java</kbd>) files for the project. This directory is also the directory where the project file (<kbd>.prj</kbd>) is stored. The Source Directory field is read-only.
<p>
<dt><b>Type</b>
<dd>The type of the project: Applet, Standalone, Package, or Beans.
<p>
<dt><b>Included Projects</b>
<dd>List of projects that are included (nested) as elements in the project. Projects are built in the order in which they are listed. Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the order.
<p>
Included projects are useful if you have a standalone program that imports packages you wrote. Each package is in its own project, and the standalone program is in its own project. To ensure the imported packages are up-to-date, include the projects in the standalone project.
<p>
<dt><b>Java Files</b>
<dd>List of files that are included as components in a JavaBeans project. You can change the status of a file by clicking the Java Bean checkbox.
<p>
If the Java Bean checkbox is selected, the class file for the <code>.java</code> file will be identified as a bean in the JAR file. The JAR file is generated by building the bean project.
