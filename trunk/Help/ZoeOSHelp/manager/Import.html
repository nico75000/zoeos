<h1>Adding an Existing Portfolio</h1>
You can add a portfolio that already exists into JDE. This portfolio may be one that someone else created or one that you previously created but then removed.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To add an existing portfolio:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the Project's button <img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif"> on the JDE main toolbar. 
<br>The JDE Project Manager window is displayed.
<li>In the project manager, choose File -> Add -> Portfolio.
<br>The Add Portfolio dialog box is displayed.
<li>In the Portfolio file box, type the path name of the portfolio, before the <tt>.psf</tt> extension.
<br>Or click the Browse button and use the file chooser to select a directory.
<li>Click the Add button.
</ol>
JDE stores the portfolio's name and maintains a link to the actual portfolio. The added portfolio is now the current portfolio and the added portfolio name is displayed in the project manager. To view the added portfolio, click the + next to <tt>My Portfolios</tt> in the project manager.
