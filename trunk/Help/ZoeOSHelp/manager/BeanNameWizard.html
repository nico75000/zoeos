<h1>Creating a Bean Component</h1>
Using JavaBeans, you can create and combine reusable software building blocks. A JavaBeans component built once can be integrated without further code changes using any tool that conforms to the JavaBeans architecture.
<p>
You can create multiple beans in a beans project.

<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To add a bean:</b>
<ol>
<li>Type the name of the bean in the Bean Name box.
<br>The name of the bean can be one of the following:
<ul>
<li>A short file name, for example, <code>Jelly</code>
<li>A full path name, for example, <code>my-install-dir\BeanBag\Jelly</code>
</ul>
<li>Decide if you want the bean to have an accompanying BeanInfo file and/or a Customizer file, and select the appropriate checkbox(es).
<br>You can select both the BeanInfo check box and Customizer check box, or just one, depending on your component plan.
<ul>
<li>By selecting the BeanInfo file checkbox, Java WorkShop creates a default BeanInfo source file for the bean that you can modify or extend. 
<li>By selecting the Customizer file checkbox, Java WorkShop creates a default Customizer source file that you can modify.
</ul>
<li>Click Create New Java Bean.
<br>Java WorkShop automatically adds the <code>.java</code> suffix to each bean file name, and adds the file to the Java Files list.
<li>Decide if you want to add another bean to this project. 
<ul>
<li>If you want to add another bean, repeat steps 1 - 3 above. 
<li>If you do not want to add another bean, click Finish.
</ul>
<p>
Java WorkShop creates source templates for each <i>non-existing</i> file in the New Bean Card list. The source editor shows the source code for the project's first file. And, the project is added to the project manager.
</ol>
