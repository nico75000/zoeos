<h1>Copying an Applet Into an HTML File</h1>

<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To copy an applet tag and paste it into an HTML file:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the Project's button <img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=BOTTOM><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif">on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<li>Click the name of the applet project that you want to copy.
<li>Choose Project -> Copy Applet Tag.
<li>In the source editor, open the project where you want to place the applet; then click where you want to paste the applet tag.
<li>In the Java WorkShop main menu, choose Edit -> Paste.
<li>Save the file by choosing File -> Save.
</ol>
<p>
<br>Java WorkShop pastes the entire HTML file into the source editor. You may want to edit this file because it includes more than just the <applet> tag.
