<h1>Removing a Project From a Portfolio</h1>

When you remove a project from a portfolio, Java WorkShop also removes the project name from the project manager. Java WorkShop does not delete the <kbd>.prj</kbd> and other project files from your file system.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To remove a project from a portfolio:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the Project's button <img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=BOTTOM><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<li>You cannot remove the <i>current</i> project. If the project you want to remove is the current project, double-click on another one first.
<li>In the project manager, select the name of the project that you want to remove.
<li>Choose File -> Remove Project From Portfolio.
</ol>
<p>
Because Java WorkShop does not delete the project from your file system, you can later import it by choosing File -> Import -> Project.
