<h1>Adding an Existing Project</h1>

You can add a project that either you or someone else created into any portfolio for which you have write permission. The project you add does not have to be in a portfolio. Added projects behave just like projects you create in Java WorkShop.
<p>
You can add a project by reference, or you can copy it into a directory.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To add an existing project:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the Project's button <img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif">on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<li>Double-click the name of the portfolio into which you want to add the project.
<li>In the project manager, choose File -> Add -> Project.
<li>Type the absolute path name of the project you want to import in the box.
<br>Or click Browse and use the file chooser to select the directory and project name that you want to add.
<li>Select how to add the project:
<ul>
<li><b>Copy.</b> Stores copies of the project files (<kbd>.prj</kbd> file, source files, and data files) in the destination directory. Go to step 6.
<li><b>Reference.</b> Stores only the project's file name in the portfolio and maintains a link between the project in the portfolio and the project file. If you are adding a project by reference, click the Finish button.
</ul>
<li>If you are copying the project files, click Next.
<li>Type a name for the project in the text box.
<li>Type the path name of the directory in which you want to store the project files.
<li>Click Finish.
<br>Java WorkShop adds the project into the current portfolio and to the project manager. The added project becomes the current project.
</ol>
