<h1>Creating Subprojects</h1>

Projects can include subprojects. Subproject's are useful when you have a program that adds packages. You can create a project for the program and a subproject for each package.
<p>
Subprojects are created using the same Create Project wizard that you use when you create a project.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To create a subproject within a project:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the Project's button <img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif">on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<li>In the project manager, double-click on the project name in which you want to include a subproject.
<li>Choose File -> New -> Subproject.
<br>The Create Project wizard is displayed.
<li>Complete the <a href="ProjectWizard.html">Create Project wizard</a> using your subproject information.
</ol>
<H2>Example</H2>
Suppose you want to create a project with many subprojects, each of which has <kbd>.java</kbd> files:
<dl>
<dd><kbd>/tina/myproj/main</kbd>--contains <kbd>Main.java</kbd> and several other <kbd>.java</kbd> files
<dd><kbd>/tina/myproj/main/readers</kbd>--contains several <kbd>.java</kbd> files
<dd><kbd>/tina/myproj/main/writers</kbd>--contains several <kbd>.java</kbd> files
<dd><kbd>/tina/myproj/main/utils</kbd>--contains several <kbd>.java</kbd> files
</dl>
<p>
Both the <kbd>readers</kbd> and <kbd>writers</kbd> subprojects have <kbd>.java</kbd> files that are added from <kbd>utils</kbd>. 
<br>To set up the example:
<ol>
<li>Create a project named <kbd>Main</kbd> in the <kbd>main</kbd> directory.
<li>Create a subproject named <kbd>readers</kbd> in the <kbd>readers</kbd> directory.
<li>Create a subproject named <kbd>writers</kbd> in the <kbd>writers</kbd> directory.
<li>Create a subproject named <kbd>utils</kbd> in the <kbd>utils</kbd> directory.
<li>Make the <kbd>Main</kbd> project the current project and choose Project -> Edit.
<li>In the Included Projects field in the General tab, list the projects as 
follows:
<ol>
<li><kbd>utils</kbd>
<li><kbd>readers</kbd>
<li><kbd>writers</kbd>
</ol>
</ol>
When you build the <kbd>main</kbd> project, the included projects are built in the order in which they are listed.
