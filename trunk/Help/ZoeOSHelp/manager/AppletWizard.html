<h1>Naming a Source File Location and Indicating Existing Sources</h1>
This page explains how to indicate a directory where you want to store your project.

<h2>The Project Storage Directory</h2>
The project storage directory box lists the directory where Java WorkShop will keep the source files for the new project. You can provide an alternative to the default storage directory.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To store files in a directory other than the default:</b>
<ol>
<li>Select the default storage directory name.
<li>Type the name of the new directory where you want Java WorkShop to store the source files for this project.
<br>If the new directory does not exist, Java WorkShop will create it.
</ol>

<h2>Existing Project Files</h2>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>If you have existing Java files, you can add these files to the project you are creating:</b>

<ul>
<li>To add existing files, click Yes.
<li>If you do not have existing files, click No.
</ul>
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>Depending on your scenario do one of the following:</b>
<ul>
<li>If you are creating an applet project without existing source, review the <a href="GenerateHtml.html"> next wizard window</a>.
<li>If you are creating an applet or standalone project with existing source files, review the <a href="ExistingSources.html"> next wizard window</a>.
<li>If you are creating a standalone project without existing sources, click Finish.
<br>Java WorkShop adds the project name to the project manager, and the source editor window displays a project template to which you can add your source code.
</ul>
