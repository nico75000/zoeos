<h1>Creating a Standalone Program Project</h1>
You can create a standalone application in any portfolio for which you have write permission. When you create a standalone program project, you <i>must</i> provide a project name. Java WorkShop supplies default values for all other project attributes.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To create a standalone program:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click the Project's button <img src="../images/tb-project-manager_u.gif" align=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> on the Java WorkShop main toolbar.
<li>Double-click on the portfolio name where you want the standalone project to be placed.
<li>Choose File -> New -> Project.
<li>Type the name of your project in the box where <kbd>untitled</kbd> appears.
<br>Make sure you are consistent in the use of capitalization in project and file names (even if you are working on Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 95, where file names are not case-sensitive). Java WorkShop is case-sensitive.
<li>Click the Standalone radio button.
<li>Decide whether your application will have a GUI and select the radio button for your project's type of interface.
<br>To create an application with a GUI using the Visual Java GUI builder, select The GUI will be created using the Visual Java GUI Builder; to create a GUI without using the GUI builder, select The GUI will be created manually; and to create an application without a GUI, select No GUI.
<li>Click Next.
<li>In the text box where Java WorkShop displays the default path name, type the path name of the directory where you want to keep your project.
<br>If the directory does not exist, Java WorkShop will create it.
<li>Decide whether you want to add existing source files:
<ul>
<li>If you do not want to add existing source files, make sure the No radio button is selected. Skip to Step 13.
<li>If you <i>do</i> want to add existing source files, click the Yes radio button and click Next.
</ul>
<li>Click either the Add All in Directory or Add button to add source files to the list of project files.
<li>Click Next.
<li>If you want a name other than the default class file name, type the new name in the Main Class box.
<li>Click Finish.
</ul>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>
Java WorkShop creates the <i>project</i><kbd>.prj</kbd> file using the name, source file names, and other information you supplied, and stores the project in the directory you specified. The project name is added to the project manager. 
<p>
If you are creating a new source file, a new project template is displayed in the source editor. If you indicated in the Create Project wizard that there are existing source files, the source editor supplies the existing source files. If you chose to use the Visual Java GUI builder, the GUI builder palette is displayed. 
</ol>
<p>
You can change the project's default attribute values by choosing Edit -> Project. These attributes define the project's individual characteristics such as how it appears in the portfolio. For a listing of all project attributes, see <a href="EditProject.html">Editing Project Attributes</a>.
