<h1>Adding or Removing Existing Sources for a Bean Project</h1>
You can add existing Java and bean files to a beans project or remove them from the Project Files list using the information on this page.
<p>
<h2>Adding Files</h2>
You can add existing files to your new beans project by either adding all of the files in the source directory or adding individual files from any directory. Use the appropriate steps below to add existing files:
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To add all of the files in the project source directory:</b>
<ul>
<li>Click Add All in Directory.
<br>All of the files in the project's source directory will be added to the Project Files list. The Project Files list indicates each file name to be added to the project, and whether the file is a bean file. If the Java Bean check box is selected, the file is a bean; if the Java Bean check box is not selected, the file is not a bean.
</ul>
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To add a file from another directory:</b>
<ol>
<li>Click Add.
<br>The file chooser is displayed.
<li>Type the path and file name of the file you want to add.
<li>Click OK.
<br>The file you specified will be added to the Project Files list. The Project Files list indicates each file name to be added to the project, and whether the file is a bean. If the Java Bean check box is selected, the file is a bean; if the Java Bean check box is not selected, the file is not a bean.
</ol>


<h2>Removing Files</h2>
If after adding files to the Project Files list, you decide you want to remove any or all of the files, do one of the following: 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To remove one file:</b>
<ol>
<li>Select the file you want to remove by clicking on the file name.
<li>Click Delete.
<br>The file is removed from the Project Files list .
</ol>

<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To remove all of the files from the project file list:</b>
<ul>
<li>Click Delete All.
<br>All of the files in the Project Files list are removed.
</ul>

<h2>Changing the Status of a Java Bean</h2>
If you specified existing beans files to add to your project, you can change the bean status using the information below.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To change the status of your project:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Java Bean check box for the file you want to change.
<br>The Create Project wizard changes the status of your file.
</ol>

<h2>After Adding Existing Source Files</h2>
Depending on your project scenario, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>If you are creating a new Java bean, click Next. Then, review the <a href="BeanNameWizard.html">next wizard window</a>.
<li>If you do not have either JavaBeans, BeanInfo files, or Customizer files to add to the project, click Finish.
</ul>
