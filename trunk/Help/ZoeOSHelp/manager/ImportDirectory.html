<h1>Creating a Name and a Source File Location for an Added Project</h1>
After indicating the project you want to copy, create a name and source file location for this project.

<h2>Naming the Copied Project</h2>
You can change the name of the project you are copying.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To rename the project:</b>
<ol>
<li>Select the default project name.
<li>Type the new name for the project you are copying in the New project name box.
</ol>

<h2>Naming the Project Storage Directory</h2>
The project storage directory box lists the directory where Java WorkShop will keep the source files for the new project.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To designate a storage directory:</b>
<ul>
<li>Type the name of the directory where you want Java WorkShop to store the source files for this project in the storage directory box.
<br>If the new directory does not exist, Java WorkShop will create it.
<li>Click Finish.
<br>Java WorkShop adds the project name to the project manager, and the source editor window displays the source code.
</ul>
