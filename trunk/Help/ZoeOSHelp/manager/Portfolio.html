<h1>What Is a Portfolio?</h1>

Portfolios group projects together in the project manager. The portfolio you are presently working in is your <i>current</i> portfolio.
<p>
When you first run JDE, the  <tt> personal</tt> portfolio is created in the project manager as your default portfolio. You have write access to this portfolio.
<p>
JDE saves the current portfolio from one session to the next. JDE also saves the current project if you have write access to the portfolio where the project is stored.

<h2>Portfolio Operations</h2>

Using the project manager, you can:
<ul>
<li>Create a portfolio
<li>Add an existing portfolio that is local to your file system
<li>Remove a portfolio from JDE
</ul>

<h2>Portfolio Files</h2>
JDE stores a portfolio in a file called <i>portfolioname</i><tt>.psf</tt>. The file is built in the directory that you specify when you create the portfolio.
<p>
The location of your personal portfolio depends on the platform you run and where you installed JDE. Review the following information for the location of your personal portfolio:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>On Microsoft Windows NT
<dd>If <tt>HOME</tt> is defined, <i>your_home_dir</i><tt>\jws</tt>
<dd>If <tt>HOME</tt> is not defined, <tt>c:\windows\jws</tt> 
<p>
<dt>On Microsoft Windows 95
<dd>If <tt>HOME</tt> is defined, <i>your_home_dir</i><tt>\jws</tt>
<dd>If <tt>HOME</tt> is not defined, <tt>c:\windows\jws</tt>
<p>
<dt>On Solaris<sup>TM</sup>
<dd>The <tt>personal</tt> portfolio file, <tt>personal.psf</tt>, is located in the <tt>jws</tt> directory in your home directory.
</dl>
<p>
The <tt>jws</tt> directory in your home directory contains a list of the portfolios loaded into your current JDE session.
