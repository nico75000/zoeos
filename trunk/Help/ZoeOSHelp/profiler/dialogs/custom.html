<H1>Custom Filter Dialog Box</H1>
Use the Custom Filter dialog box to create a list of method
names that you want included or excluded from the profiler
displays.  Use the asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) character as a wildcard. For
example, the following entries represent all methods that
begin with the characters <tt>java.</tt> and <tt>sun.</tt>:
<pre>
   java.*
   sun.*
</pre>
<p>

create lists that both exclude <em>and</em> include methods.
