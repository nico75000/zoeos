<H1>JDE Profiler</H1>
The JDE profiler helps you analyze the performance of
your program.  Use the profiler to determine:
<ul>
<li>How much time is spent in each of the program's methods (and
optionally, in the methods that they in turn call)
<li>How many times each of the methods is executed
</ul> 
<p>

<A NAME="collect"></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To collect profile data:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run your project using one of the following methods:
<ul>
<li>Choose Project -> Profile from the main menubar.
<li>Click <strong><IMG SRC="../images/tb-profile_u.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE></strong> on the main toolbar.
</ul>
At the end of execution, profile data is written to the file <em>project-name</em><code>.prof</code> in the project source directory (defined when you <A HREF="../manager/CreateApplet.html">created the project</A>).
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif"><br>
The profile data file <em>project-name</em><code>.prof</code>
is overwritten each time you run the program.  To
save the data from a given run, rename it before
you run the program again.
</ul>

<A NAME="view"></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To view profile data:</strong>

<ul>
<li>After the project run terminates, the Profile Display window
automatically opens with the profile data from that run.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif"><br> You can manually
start the profiler by choosing Windows -> Profile Results from the main JDE menubar.  Then
choose File -> Open in the Profile Display
window to load profile data for a particular project into
the display.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/profiler/profiler_small.gif">
<p>
The top pane of the profiler window lists the names of all
the methods (except those filtered out) in your program
that were executed.  When you select a method in any of the
three panes, the names of methods that they in turn call
and are called <em>by</em> are displayed in the bottom two
panes.  Information about those methods is displayed both
graphically (as a bar graph) and numerically.
<p>
<A NAME="data">
You can view three types of data about methods:
</A>
<table width=90% border=0 cellspacing=12>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Self Times</strong></td>
<td width=60%>
The time (in milliseconds) spent in the body
of the displayed method (does not include the time spent
in methods called by this method)
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Cumulative Times</strong></td>
<td>
The time (in milliseconds) spent in the displayed
method, in all methods called by the displayed method,
in all methods called by <em>those</em> methods, and so
on
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Call Counts</strong></td>
<td>
The number of times the method was called by any
other methods
</td>
</tr>

</table>
</ul>

<A NAME="change_type"></A>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif"><strong>To change data type:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Use the items in the <A HREF="menus.html#data">Data
