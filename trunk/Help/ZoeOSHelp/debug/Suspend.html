<h1>Suspending Execution of a Thread
</h1>You can suspend execution of any nonsystem thread. Once you suspend execution, you can view local (stack) and instance variables.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To suspend execution of a single thread:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the Threads/Stack window by choosing Debug -> Threads/Stack.
<li>Select the thread you want to suspend by clicking on its name.
<li>Click Suspend Thread.
<br>The glyph next to the thread changes to <img src="../../../../images/db_19_u.gif"><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> to indicate the thread is suspended.
</ol>

<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To suspend execution of all nonsystem threads:</b>
<ul>
<li>Click Suspend All in the Threads/Stack window.
</ul>
<p>
To resume execution from the exact point you left off, select a thread by clicking on its name, and then click Resume Thread.
<p>
Suspending a thread is not as precise as setting a breakpoint because you cannot control exactly where the thread is executing when you suspend it. Suspend a thread in cases where you can't set a breakpoint--for example, when your program encounters an infinite loop and you aren't sure where to set a breakpoint.
