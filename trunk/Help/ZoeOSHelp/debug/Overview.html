<h1>Debugging with JDE</h1>
This page explains what you need to know before debugging in JDE,<sup>TM</sup> and information on using the debugger.

<h2>Before Debugging</h2>
To debug your applet or standalone programs with JDE, you <i>must</i> build your program using the <code>-g</code> option for the compiler. Before you build and compile your program, make sure these options are set by choosing Project -> Edit. In the Edit Project window's Build Tab, you can specify the <code>-g</code> option in the Javac options box.
<p>
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft NT users must <a href="../misc/tcp.html">install and configure TCP/IP</a> software before using the JDE debugger.

<h2>Using the Debugger</h2>
After you build your program inside JDE, you can use the Debug menu and the <A HREF="../toolbars/pce_debug.html">Edit/Debug Toolbar</a> buttons to debug your program.
<p>
To examine your source code, you'll first want to <a href="BreakpointOverview.html">set a breakpoint</a> in your program before starting a debugging session -- the debugger does not automatically set any breakpoints in a program. 
<p>
If you haven't set any breakpoints in your program before you begin a debugging session, you can do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Choose Debug -> Interrupt Program, to halt the execution of your program.
<li>Choose Debug -> Breakpoints, to set a breakpoint in your program.
</ul>

<p>
Once you start debugging your project's source code in the source editor, you can examine the stack, variables and global variables using the <a href="Threads.html">Threads/Stack window</a>.

<p>
While debugging your Java program, you can also:
<ul>
<li><a href="Eval.html">Evaluate expressions</a> (local or global) within the scope of the method you are stopped in.
<li><a href="Exceptions.html">Use the Exceptions Window</a> to tell the debugger how to handle exceptions generated in your code.
<li><a href="Messages.html">View input and output</a> activities generated by the debugger.
</ul>
