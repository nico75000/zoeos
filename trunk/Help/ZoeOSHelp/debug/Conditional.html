<h1>Setting a Conditional Breakpoint
</h1>Using the Breakpoints window, you can make your program stop at a breakpoint only when a specified condition is true.

<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To set a conditional breakpoint:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the Breakpoints window by choosing Debug -> Breakpoints.
<br>The JDE Breakpoints window is displayed.
<li>Click Show Advanced.
<br>JDE expands the Breakpoints window.
<li>Type a class name in the Class name box.
<li>Type either a method name or line number in the Location box.
<li>Type an expression value in the Expression box.
<br>For example, if you want to stop at the breakpoint only when <kbd>b == 10</kbd>, type <kbd>b == 10</kbd> in the Expression box.
<li>Click Set Breakpoint.
<br>The breakpoint is set and added to the breakpoints list
