<h1>Showing the Source of a Stack Frame</h1>

From the debugger's Threads/Stack window, you can select a stack frame and view its source in the source editor.

</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the Threads/Stack window by choosing Debug -> Threads/Stack.
<li>Click the + icon to expand the thread group and show the call stack in a thread. 
<li>Select a stack frame.

JDE brings the source editor to the front and displays the source of the method that corresponds to the stack frame.  The line that was being executed is highlighted.
