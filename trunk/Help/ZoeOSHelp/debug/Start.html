<h1>Starting a Debugging Session</h1>

This page explains how to start debugging a standalone program or applet project. To begin, you must have a project that you compiled inside JDE with the <kbd>-g</kbd> option. If you don't have such a project, debugging is disabled.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13" ALGIN=MIDDLE><b>To start debugging a project:</b>
<ol>
<li>Double-click a project in the Project Manager window to select the project you want to debug.
<br>The source editor window automatically loads your program source files (if the sources are available).
<li><a href="Breakpoint.html">Set a breakpoint</a> in your program.
<li>Click the Restart button <IMG SRC="../images/db-restart_u.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> on the Edit/Debug toolbar.
<br>The following actions occur:
<ul>
<li>JDE begins debugging your project. If you set a breakpoint in your source code,the line with the breakpoint changes from red to green to indicate where program execution stopped. You can now set additional breakpoints.

<li>If your project is an applet, JDE launches the applet viewer. You execute the applet in the applet viewer using the Go button <IMG SRC="../images/db-resume_u.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif">on the Edit/Debug toolbar. 
</ul>
</ol>


On Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT, the applet viewer does not respond to window operations, such as repainting, when the applet is suspended at a breakpoint. To manipulate the viewer under these circumstances, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Press Alt+Tab to bring the viewer to the front.
<li>Press Control+Escape to display the task list.
</ul>
