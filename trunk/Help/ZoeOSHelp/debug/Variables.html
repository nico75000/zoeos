<h1>Evaluating Data Values
</h1>Using the Expression Evaluation window, you can evaluate an expression that is within the scope of the method you are stopped in. An expression has a value when it is within the scope of the current location on the call stack.
<p>
You can use either the Expression Evaluation window or the Threads/Stack window to get the value of an expression. If you want to track the changes in a variable as the program progresses, use the Threads/Stack window.
<p>

<ol>
<li>Choose Debug -> Evaluate.
<li>Type the expression you want to evaluate in the Expression box.
<li>Click Evaluate.
</ol>
<p>
JDE prints the expression and its value in the <a href="Messages.html">Debug tab</a>, below the source editor window.
<p>
When evaluating an expression, JDE does not distinguish package names from expression names. Consider the strings <kbd>java.io.File.separator</kbd> and <kbd>myObj.myMember.myString</kbd>. JDE does not recognize that <kbd>java.io.File</kbd> is a package name and that <kbd>myObj.myMember</kbd> is a member of an object. In all cases, the debugger treats package names as members of objects.
