<h1>Remotely Debugging a Program
</h1>You can run a program on one machine and debug the program from another machine using your network connection. Your network file system must be available from both the remote and local computers.
<p>

<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To debug a program on a remote machine:</b>
<ol>
<li>From a command line on your local computer, log on to the remote computer.
<li>Start up a debugger agent with the classpath for your application:
   <ul>
   <li>Check to see that the Java Workshop bin directory is in your path.
   <li>Type the following:
   <br><code>jws_rdebug -classpath <your classpath></code>
   <li>Note the Agent password that is printed.
   </ul>
<li>Then, on the local machine:
   <ul>
   <li>Start Java Workshop, if necessary.
   <li>Choose the project corresponding to your application.
   <li>Choose Project -> Edit.
   <li>Click the Debug/Browse tab.
   <li>Click the Remote Debugging radio button and click OK.
   <li>Click the Restart button on the Edit/Debug toolbar.
   <li>In the Remote Debugging window, type the name of the remote computer and the Agent password from step 2.
   <li>Click OK.
   </ul>
</ol>
JDE now begins the remote debugging session. You can use all of the local debugging functions to debug a program on your remote machine.
