<h1>Adding an Exception</h1>

Using the Exceptions window, you can instruct the debugger to handle exceptions generated in your code. An exception is a signal that indicates some type of condition has occurred. 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To add an exception to the list:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the Exceptions window by choosing Debug -> Exceptions.
<li>Type the class name of the exception in the Exception box.
<br>For example, <kbd>java.lang.ThreadDeath</kbd> is thrown when the thread terminates.
<li>Click Add.
<br>JDE inserts the exception into the scrolling list. 
</ol>
<p>
JDE supports three types of exception settings.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Break on Uncaught</b>
<dd>This setting is the default. The debugger intercepts the exception only if there is no corresponding catch block. 
<p>
<dt><b>Break Always</b>
<dd>If you set an exception to Break Always, the exception is treated like a breakpoint even if you have recovery code in your program.
<p>
<dt><b>Ignore</b>
<dd>If you set an exception to Ignore, then the debugger does not intervene; you will get the same behavior as you would if you were running the program without the debugger.
</dl>
<p>
You can change an exception's setting by selecting the exception and then 
clicking the button of the desired setting.
