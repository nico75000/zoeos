<h1>Running to a Specific Location
</h1>The debugger can execute your program until it reaches a certain location in your code.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To run to a specific location:</b>
<ol>
<li>In the source editor window, click in the line where you want to stop program execution.
<li>Click the To here button <img src="../images/db-run-to-here_u.gif" align="MIDDLE"><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> on the Edit/Debug toolbar.
</ol>
After running to a specific location, you can continue with other debugging actions such as stepping and evaluating. If you want to stop program execution every time the program reaches the line, set a breakpoint.
