<h1>Viewing Threads and Stack Frames
</h1>Using the Threads/Stack window, you can view the threads in a thread group, the stack frames in a thread, the variables local to each stack frame, and the variables contained within objects and arrays. You can also keep track of the value of a variable while you step through your code.
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To view threads, stack frames, and variables:</b>
<ol>
<li>Choose Debug -> Threads/Stack.
<br>The Threads/Stack window lists the all thread groups in your project, including the system thread groups.
<li>Click the + icon next to the <img src="../../../../images/db_01_u.gif" align=BOTTOM><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> thread group.
<br>JDE expands the thread group to show the threads that make up the thread group.
<li>Continue clicking the + icons on the left until you reach the variables in a stack frame.
<li>Click the - icon to contract the item.
</ol>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>Tips</b>
<ul>
<li>If a stack frame does not display local variables, try recompiling your program with the <kbd>-g</kbd> option.
<li>Applets run in multiple threads.  For example, the <kbd>init</kbd>, 
<kbd>start</kbd>, and <kbd>stop</kbd> methods run under one thread, while 
<kbd>paint</kbd> and <kbd>handleEvents</kbd> run under another (AWT-Motif on Solaris<sup>TM</sup> computing environments and AWT-CallBack-Win32 on Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 95 systems.)
</ul>
