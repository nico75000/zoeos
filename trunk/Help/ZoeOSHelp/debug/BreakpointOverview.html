<h1>Introduction to Breakpoints
</h1>A breakpoint is a location in your program where you want the program to stop executing. You can set and clear breakpoints in either the source editor or the Breakpoints window.
<p>
In the source editor, you can set or clear a breakpoint in a line of code. Use the Breakpoint button <IMG SRC="../images/db-stop-at_u.gif" ALIGN=TOP><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> on the Edit/Debug toolbar to quickly set a breakpoint. Click this button again to remove a breakpoint from the current code line in the source editor.
<p>
In the Breakpoints window, you can set or clear a breakpoint at a line of code, in a method, on an expression, or after a specified number of hits. This window also displays all breakpoints set in your program. Choose Debug -> Breakpoints to open the Breakpoints window.
<p>
<a href="Breakpoint.html">Using the Breakpoints window</a>, you can set a breakpoint while your program is running. When you set a breakpoint, you must specify a class and either the name of a method or a source file line number. If you specify a method name, the breakpoint is set in the first instruction in that method. The program runs to the breakpoint and stops.
<p>
JDE supports "persistent" breakpoints. The breakpoints remain in the proper line of code even when your program changes.
