<h1>Setting a Breakpoint in a Method
</h1>Use the Breakpoints window to set a breakpoint in a specified method.  
<p>
<img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13"><b>To set a breakpoint in a specified method:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the Breakpoints window by choosing Debug -> Breakpoints.
<li>Type a class name in the Class name box.
<br>For example, if you are setting a breakpoint in the class <kbd>Circle</kbd> in the Java package <kbd>mypkg.shapes</kbd>, type <kbd>mypkg.shapes.Circle</kbd>.
<li>Type a method name in the Location box.
<li>Click Set Breakpoint.
<br>JDE sets the breakpoint in the first bytecode of the specified method, and highlights the line containing the breakpoint in red. The breakpoint is also added to the list of currently active breakpoints in the Breakpoints window.  
</ol>
