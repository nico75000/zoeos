<h1>Using the Breakpoints Window
</h1>Open the Breakpoints window by choosing Debug -> Breakpoints. You can use the Breakpoints window to do the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="StopInBreakpoint.html">Set a breakpoint in a method</a>
<li><a href="StopAtBreakpoint.html">Set a breakpoint in a line</a>
<li><a href="Counted.html">Set a counted breakpoint</a>
<li><a href="Conditional.html">Set a conditional breakpoint</a>
</ul>
