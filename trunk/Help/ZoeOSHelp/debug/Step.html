<h1>Stepping Into a Method</h1>

When you step into a method, JDE executes one source line; if the source line is a method call, JDE stops just before executing the first statement of the method.

<ul>
<li>Click the Into button <img src="../images/db-step-into_u.gif" align="MIDDLE"><img src="../../images/spacer2_t.gif"> on the Edit/Debug toolbar.
</ul>
<p>
If you step into a method for which the source code is not available, the debugger highlights the line in purple. To continue debugging, either click the To Here button on the Edit/Debug toolbar or set a breakpoint and click the Go button.
