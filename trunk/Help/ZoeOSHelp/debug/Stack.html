<h1>Moving on the Call Stack</h1>

You can navigate through the call stack using the Callee and Caller buttons on the Edit/Debug toolbar. The call stack includes all methods that have been called but have not returned to the caller. The methods in the call stack are listed in the reverse order of how they were called. The method that was executing when the program stopped is at the top of the stack.
