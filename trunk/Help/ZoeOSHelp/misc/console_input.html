<H1>Console Input Dialog Box</H1>
Programs that normally accept command-line input use the
Console window for that input in JDE. Use the
Console Input dialog box to control how that input is
treated.
<p>
<table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=12>
<tr valign="top">
<td width=30%><strong>A line at a time</strong></td>
<td width=70%>
Sends the input to the process when the user presses Return
(or Enter).  In this mode, you can use Backspace to modify
input before it is sent.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width=30%><strong>Include prompt</strong></td>
<td width=70%>
This suboption allows you to use cut and paste, or
click-to-insert, to edit the input before it is sent.
<em>All</em> text on the current line is sent, including
prompts that the program prints.  
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=18>
<br>
If you use cut and paste, enable this option and delete the
prompt (using Backspace or Cut) before pasting the input
and pressing Enter or Return.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width=30%><strong>Each keystroke immediately</strong></td>
<td width=70%>
Sends each keystroke as it is typed.  The input may not be
edited.  This mode is suitable when debugging applications
(like vi) that expect to see literal Backspace characters.
This option is similar to the UNIX "raw mode."
