<H1>Configuring TCP/IP</H1>
To use the Java WorkShop debugger, you must install and
configure TCP/IP software on your Microsoft Windows 95 or
Windows NT system.

<h2>Microsoft Windows 95</h2>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=18><strong>To install TCP/IP on your computer:</strong>
<ol>
<li>From the Windows 95 Start menu, select
Settings -> Control Panel.
<li>In the Control Panel window, double-click on the Network icon. 
<li>In the Configuration tab of the Network window, click Add.
<li>In the Select Network Component Type window, select the
Protocol item from the list and click Add.
<li>In the Select Network Protocol window, select Microsoft from the Manufacturers pane, and select TCP/IP from the Network pane. Click OK. 
<li>In the Select Device window, select Microsoft from the
Manufacturers pane.  Dial-Up Adapter is automatically
selected in the Models pane. Click OK.
<li>TCP/IP (as well as a number of other components) should
now appear in the Network window components pane. Click OK
in the Network window.  A window appears to indicate
that the protocols are being installed.
<li>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.
</ol>
<p>
If your computer is set up to prompt you whenever it uses
dial-up networking, you will see the same prompt when you
start the Java WorkShop debugger (once per Java WorkShop
session).  If you want to discontinue dial-up prompting,
follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the My Computer icon.
<li>In the My Computer window, double-click on the Dial-Up Networking
icon.
<li>From the main menu, choose Connections -> Settings.
<li>Click on Don't prompt to use Dial-Up Networking.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Microsoft Windows NT</h2>
Use these instructions to install TCP/IP on a Windows NT 
standalone machine.  These instructions describe one
method of installation; there are others that work as well.
<p>
If your machine is part of a network and you are encountering
this error, please contact your system administrator.
<p>
