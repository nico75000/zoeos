<H1>Source Editor Tabs and Indentation</H1>
Use the Source Editor Preferences dialog box
(Preferences -> Source Editor) to configure tab
and indent settings for the source editor.  You can also
use this dialog box to turn Auto Indent
on or off.
<p>
<table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=12>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Auto Indent</strong></td>
<td width=65%>
Causes the editor to automatically indent the next line to the
same column position as the most recently inserted line.
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Indent Size</strong></td>
<td>
The number of columns (in space characters) between indent
locations.  When you press the Tab key, the cursor moves to
the next indent location. The default value is four
spaces.
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Tab Size</strong></td>
<td>
The number of space characters the editor converts to one
tab character.  The default value is eight spaces.
</tr>

</table>
<p>
For example, if Indent Size is set to nine characters and
Tab Size is set to four characters, the editor will convert
the interval between every indent stop to be two tab characters
and one space character.
