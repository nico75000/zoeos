</ul>
<p>

<A NAME="keyboard"></A>
<h2>Keyboard Commands</h2>
You can use the keyboard to execute many source editor
commands and to navigate within the source editor window.
See <A HREF=dialogs/actions.html#editing>Keyboard
Actions</A> for a list of these commands.
<p>
You can customize the keys that are assigned to these
commands.  Use the Keyboard Preferences dialog box
(Preferences -> Keyboard) to view, add, or
delete key assignments.



<A NAME="multiple"></A>
<h2>Editing Multiple Views of the Same File</h2>
There are two ways to edit the same file in multiple editor
windows:
<ul>
<li>Choose File -> Clone Editor Window.
<ul>
<li>A new editor window is loaded with the same file.  
<li>The cursor in the cloned editor is positioned at the
same location.
<li>This process can be repeated multiple times.
</ul>
<li>Use File -> Open to open a file that is
already loaded in another editor window.
</ul>
Things to be aware of when editing files in
multiple editors:
<ul>
<li>The multiple editors all operate on the same copy of
the file in memory.
<li>When you change the contents of the file in one of the
editors, the displays in all of the other connected editors are
updated.
<li>When you save the file in one of the editors, the file
is considered saved in all of the editors.
</ul>
