<H1>Version Control</H1>
JDE supports the following version
control systems (VCS):
<ul>
<li>PVCS (Microsoft Windows 95/NT)
<p>
See <A HREF="#pvcs">PVCS Notes</A> for important information.
<li>RCS (Solaris)
<li>SCCS (Solaris)
</ul>
Choose Preferences -> Version Control (in
the main JDE menu bar) to select one of these
options.  Be sure that the VCS commands are in your
execution path.
<p>
The file version control commands act on the file that is
currently open in the editor window.  Choose File
-> Version to see the version control
commands.
<p>
The following VCS commands appear in the Version submenu:
<table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=12>
<tr valign=top>
<td><strong>Checkout</strong></td>
<td width=70%>
Checks out the file currently open in the editor from the
VCS--makes the file <em>writable</em>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td><strong>Check In</strong></td>
<td>
Checks in the file that is currently open in the editor back into the
VCS--makes the file <em>read-only</em>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td><strong>Check In New</strong></td>
<td>
If the file that is currently open in the editor is not
under the control of a VCS, this command places it under
VCS control--makes the file <em>read-only</em>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td><strong>Uncheckout</strong></td>
<td>
Undoes the effect of the Checkout command.  Any modifications
you made to the file are deleted and the file is checked
back into the VCS--makes the file <em>read-only</em>.
</td>
</tr>

<H3>PVCS Notes</H3>
</A>
If you use PVCS with JDE, be aware of the following:
<ul>
<li>You must define a suffix for your archive files.  You
can define a suffix using the PVCS Version Manager, or you can edit the
appropriate configuration file. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13">To define a suffix using the 
Version Manager:
<ol>
<li>Select the project to configure in the left pane.
For example, "Master Project"
<li>Choose Project -> Configure Project
<li>In the Categories box, select New Archives
<li>In the File Extension grid, add the extension "<tt>.java</tt>"
<li>In the Archive suffix grid, add the suffix "<tt>jvva</tt>"
<li>Click OK
<li>Click Save
</ol>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/hg_proc.gif" width="18" height="13">To define a suffix by
editing the configuration file:
<ul>
<li>Typically, you add an entry to the file
<tt>C:\PVCS\MASTER.CFG</tt>. The following is a
suggestion for such an entry in <tt>C:\PVCS\MASTER.CFG</tt>:
<p>
<tt>ARCHIVESUFFIX .java = jvva</tt>
</ul>


<li>In order to use PVCS with JDE, you must set
the variable <tt>VCSCFG</tt> to the name of your
configuration file.

<ul>
<li>On Windows 95 systems, set <tt>VCSCFG</tt> in
<tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt>. For example:
<p>
<tt>SET VCSCFG=C:\PVCS\MASTER.CFG</tt>

<li>On Windows NT systems, set <tt>VCSCFG</tt>
in the System Control Panel or in <tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt>.
</ul>
</ul>
