<H1>Compiling Single Files</H1>
You can use the Build -> Compile File 
command to build only the file loaded in the main
source editor window.
<p>
The Java WorkShop builder determines the rules to
build that file using the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>If the file is found to be in the current project or
one of its sub-projects, the builder uses the <A
HREF="../manager/BuildDisplay.html"> build attributes</A>
from the project that contains the file.
<p>
<li>If the file is <em>not</em> found in the current
project or one of its sub-projects, the <A
HREF="../manager/BuildDisplay.html"> build attributes</A>
for the current project are used with the following
exceptions:
<ul>
<li>The compiled class file is placed in the same directory
as the source file.
<li>The <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> variable is set to contain
only the JDK.
</ul>
</ul>
