<h1>javac - The Java Compiler</h1>
<blockquote>
The Java<sup>TM</sup> Compiler<sup>TM</sup> <tt>javac</tt>
compiles Java programs.

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<blockquote>
<code>javac [</code> <a
href="javac.html#Options"><em>options</em></a> <code>]
filename.java ...</code>
<br>
<code>javac_g [</code> <a href="javac.html#Options"><em>options</em></a>
<code>] filename.java ...</code>
</blockquote>

<h2>Description</h2>
The <code>javac</code> command compiles Java source code into Java bytecodes.
You then use the Java interpreter - the <code>java</code>
command--to interpret the Java bytecodes.

<p>
Java source code must be contained in files whose file names
end with the <code>.java</code> extension.  The file name
must be constructed from the class name, as in
<i>classname</i><code>.java</code>, if the class is public
or is referenced from another source file.

<p>
For every class defined in each source file compiled by
<code>javac</code>, the compiler stores the resulting
bytecodes in a <em>class file</em> with a name of the form
<i>classname</i><code>.class</code>.  Unless you specify
the <code>-d</code> option, the compiler places each class
file in the same directory as the corresponding source
file.

<p>
When the compiler must refer to your own classes, you must
specify their location.  Use the <code>-classpath</code>
option or <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable to do
this.  The class path is a sequence of directories (or zip
files) which <code>javac</code> searches for classes that
are not already defined in any of the files specified
directly as command arguments.  The compiler looks in the
class path for both a source file and a class file,
recompiling the source (and regenerating the class file) if
it is newer.

<a name=Options>
<h2>Options</h2>
</a>

<dl>

<dt><code>-classpath</code><i> path</i>
<dd>
Specifies the path <code>javac</code> uses to look up
classes. Overrides the default or the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable if it is set.
Directories are separated by colons on Solaris systems and
by semicolons on Window 95/NT systems.  It is often useful
for the directory containing the source files to be on the
class path.  You should always include the system classes
at the end of the path.  For example:
<p>
<code>
javac -classpath .:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes ...
</code>
<p>

<dt><code>-d</code><i> directory</i>
<dd>
Specifies the root directory of the class file hierarchy.
For example, typing:
<p>
<code>
javac -d /home/avh/classes MyProgram.java
</code>
<p>
causes the class files for the classes in the
<code>MyProgram.java</code> source file to be saved in the
directory <code>/home/avh/classes/demos/awt</code>,
assuming that the classes are defined in the package
<code>demos/awt</code>.

<p>
The <code>-d</code> and <code>-classpath</code>
options have independent effects.  The compiler reads only
from the class path, and writes only to the destination
directory.  It is often useful for the destination
directory to be on the class path.  If the <code>-d</code>
option is not specified, the source files should be stored
in a directory hierarchy that reflects the package
structure, so that the resulting class files can be easily
located.
<p>

<dt><code>-g</code>
<dd>
Enables generation of debugging tables. Debugging tables
contain information about line numbers and local
variables--information used by Java debugging tools. By
default, only line numbers are generated, unless
optimization (<code>-O</code>) is turned on.
<p>

<dt><code>-nowarn</code>
<dd>
Turns off warnings. If used, the compiler does not print
out any warnings.
<p>

<dt><code>-O</code>
<dd>
Optimizes compiled code by inlining static, final, and
private methods.  Your classes may get larger in
size.
<p>

<dt><code>-verbose</code>
<dd>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about
what source files are being compiled and what class files
are being loaded.
<p>

<dt><code>-depend</code>
<dd>
Makes the compiler consider recompiling class
files that are referenced from other class files.
(Normally, it only recompiles missing or out-of-date class
files that are referred to from source code.)
<p>

<dt><code>-J</code><i>javaoption</i>
<dd>
Passes the string <i>javaoption</i> as a single
argument to the Java interpreter, which runs the compiler.
The argument should not contain spaces.  Multiple argument
words must all begin with the prefix <code>-J</code>, which
is stripped.  This is useful for adjusting the compiler's
execution environment or memory usage.

</dl>

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<dl>

<dt><strong>CLASSPATH</strong>
<dd>
Provides the system a path to user-defined classes.
Directories are separated by colons on Solaris systems
and by semicolons on Windows 95/NT systems. For example:
<p>
<code>
.:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
</code>
