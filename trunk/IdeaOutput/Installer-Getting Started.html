</B></I><P>If you have a SCSI connection to your E4, after ZoeOS starts up choose the "Manage/SMDI" menu item. In the SMDI manager you can couple SMDI devices to Midi devices  - doing this enables much more functionality in ZoeOS as well as significantly speeding up the initialization of sample data inside the application.</P>

<B><I><P>Communications</P>
</B></I><P>If you are having communication problems you can experiment with the communication preferences at both the system and device level. See the respective preference boxes for these settings.</P>

<B><I><P>Speedup</P>
</B></I><P>If you have more than one E4 device, you may be able to speedup communications by experimenting with the "Sysex concurrency level" in the ZoeOS preference panel.</P>

<B><I><P>Pop-ups</P>
</B></I><P>Remember a lot of functionality is available in popup-menus that can appear over most objects in ZoeOS - use the mouse right-click to access popup-menus.</P>

<B><I><P>Table Editing/Selections</P>
</B></I><P>You can use the mouse wheel in a similar way to the jog/shuttle wheel on the Emulator when you have selected cell(s) on any of the parameter tables.</P>

<P>Experiment with using the "Ctrl" and "Shift" key when making selections on tables.</P>

<P>Device Hunting</P>
</B></I><P>If you want to speedup device hunting, choose the "Manage/Midi" menu item and instruct ZoeOS to ignore ports that you are sure are not connected to any EOS devices.</P>

<B><I><P>Drag and Drop</P>
</B></I><P>Experiment with drag and drop - it's available almost everywhere!</P>

<B><I><P>Voice Table</P>
</B></I><P>Remember you can add customized parameters to the Voice Table.</P>

<B><I><P>Contact Zuonics</P>
