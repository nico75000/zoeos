For the purpose of this Agreement, User consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in	Ireland		                           	.  If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such unenforceable provision had never constituted a part hereof, and the unenforceable provision shall be automatically amended to so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable provision within the limits of applicable law. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute the same instrument.  Any waiver of a provision of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged.  A valid waiver hereunder shall not be interpreted to be a waiver of that obligation in the future or any other obligation under this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties related to the subject matter hereof, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement between the parties relating to the Software and shall not be changed except by written agreement signed by an officer of Licensor.
