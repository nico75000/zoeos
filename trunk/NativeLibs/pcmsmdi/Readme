To compile under windows make use the Makefile.vcc make file and use nmake to compile it.

nmake is part of visual studio. There is a free version available called Visual Studio Express.

Set the 3 variables at the top of the windows make file to match your own system and type nmake

You will likely have to run a batch file included with vcpp to set up your environment variables correctly.

Mine is in

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools

To compile on linux or mac use the Makefile.linux. In the make file Modify CPPFLAGS to match your java installation and
in SMDIAgent.c comment out #define _windows_.

Type make -f Makefile.linux to build the shared library
