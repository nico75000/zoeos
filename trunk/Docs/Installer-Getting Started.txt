SCSI
If you have a SCSI connection to your E4, after ZoeOS starts up choose the "Manage/SMDI" menu item. In the SMDI manager you can couple SMDI devices to Midi devices - doing this enables much more functionality in ZoeOS as well as significantly speeding up the initialization of sample data inside the application.
Communications
If you are having communication problems you can experiment with the communication preferences at both the system and device level. See the respective preference boxes for these settings.
Speedup
If you have more than one E4 device, you may be able to speedup communications by experimenting with the "Sysex concurrency level" in the ZoeOS preference panel.
Pop-ups
Remember a lot of functionality is available in popup-menus that can appear over most objects in ZoeOS - use the mouse right-click to access popup-menus.
Table Editing/Selections
You can use the mouse wheel in a similar way to the jog/shuttle wheel on the Emulator when you have selected cell(s) on any of the parameter tables.
Experiment with using the "Ctrl" and "Shift" key when making selections on tables.
Device Hunting
If you want to speedup device hunting, choose the "Manage/Midi" menu item and instruct ZoeOS to ignore ports that you are sure are not connected to any EOS devices.
Drag and Drop
Experiment with drag and drop - it's available almost everywhere!
Voice Table
Remember you can add customized parameters to the Voice Table.
Contact Zuonics
Please report any problems you may encounter or drop an email to Zuonics regarding functionality you would like to see - you could do this from the "Help" menu in ZoeOS.
