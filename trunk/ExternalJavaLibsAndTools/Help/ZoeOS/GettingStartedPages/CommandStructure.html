<h2 id="background" class="default">Background</h2>
<p>
ZoeOS organizes its functionality in a hierarchical scheme that closely matches the hierarchical representation of data in the Emulator.
<p>
At the top level are the <b>devices</b> in the system.
Each device then contains four main areas that can be addressed by ZoeOS. These are:
	<ul>
		<li>		
			The multimode section containing a collection of <b>parameters</b> for each channel in the system
			<br>(normally 16 channels, but 32 on midi expanded Emulators)
		</li>
		<li>		
			The master section containing a collection of <b>parameters</b> for each of the individual master sections
		</li>
		<li>		
			The preset collection containing all the <b>presets</b> on the device
		</li>
		<li>		
			The sample collection containing all the <b>samples</b> on the device
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Each sample in the device sample collection is:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A sample name and optionally a sample header if the device is SMDI coupled.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Each preset in the device preset collection is:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>parameters</b> representing preset global
		</li>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>voices</b> conatining the voices in the preset
		</li>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>links</b> containing the links in the preset
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Each link in the preset link collection is:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>parameters</b> for the link
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Each voice in the preset voice collection is:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>parameters</b> for the voice
		</li>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>zones</b> representing the sample zones in the voice
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	And each sample zone in the sample zone collection is:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A collection of <b>parameters</b> for the zone
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>

From the emphasized terms in the above hierarchy seven distinct types of target is derived:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Devices
		</li>
		<li>
			Parameters
		</li>
		<li>
			Samples
		</li>
		<li>
			Presets
		</li>
		<li>
			Links
		</li>
		<li>
			Voices
		</li>
		<li>
			Zones
		</li>
	</ol>
<p>
A command that operates on any one of these seven target types is called a <b>ZCommand</b>. The ZoeOS ZCommand set is a super-set of the command set
exposed by the Emulator via SysEx. This means that all the SysEx commands you can perform on the Emulator are manifested in ZoeOS as ZCommands,
but there are also other ZCommands that are aggregates of the Emulator SysEx commands and these extended commands are unique to ZoeOS.

<h2 id="zcommand_concept" class="default">ZCommand Concept</h2>
<p>
The majority of functionality in ZoeOS is accessed from ZCommands. It was mentioned previously that each ZCommand
requires a target or targets of a certain type to execute, so from now on we will refer to each ZCommand using the name of the command as it appears in the user interface of ZoeOS prefixed with the type
of target it expects e.g preset_Erase (a command that erases selected presets) or parameter_Randomize (a command that randomizes the value of selected parameters).

<h4 id="zcommand_scope" class="default">Scope</h4>
<p>
A ZCommand will generally not have any direct effect above the root of its target, but it can have an effect at levels below the root of its target.
An example of this is would be the preset_AutoMap ZCommand which auto-maps all the voices and zones within a preset
(voices and zones are at one and two levels below the root of the ZCommand target respectively). An example of a ZCommand that only has effect at its root would be 
all of the parameter ZCommands. As parameters are scalar concepts with no internal hierarchy a ZCommand can only have effect on the parameter value.
<p> 
An example of a ZCommand with broad and destructive scope is the preset_Erase ZCommand. If you select 50 presets in the 
presets palette and execute this particular command you are clobbering every one of the 50 selected presets as well as all the hierarchical levels
below each of those presets - voices, zones, links and all of their respective parameters.

<p>
In certain cases ZCommands can have side-effects. For example, performing a parameter ZCommand on one of the values in the Keyboard Win of a voice may have a constraining effect on
another parameter that is part of the Keyboard Win - this behaviour is consistent when compared to front-panel editing of editing the same parameters.
<h4 id="zcommand_context_sensitivity" class="default">Context sensitivity</h4>
<p>
ZCommands are also context sensitive in certain cases. For example, a ZCommand may be grayed-out if there are not enough targets selected for the command to have an effect. 
A good example of this is the parameter_Repeat command which requires at least 2 selected parameters as there is no concept of repeating a parameter in a selection of size 1.

<p>
<b>When used intelligently, ZCommands provide you with an unprecedented level of control of the Emulator</b>.
<p>
The ZoeOS ZCommand set will continue to grow over time and you may also request customized ZCommands from Zuonics if the need arises.

<h2 id="using_zcommands" class="default">Using ZCommands</h2>
<p>	
One way to look at ZoeOS is as a bunch of tables (a very unflattering and simplified view!).
Selecting a cell or cells on a table is in effect selecting a target or targets.
You select some parameters on a voice table for example and you are now ready to execute parameter related ZCommands.
You select some links in the far left of the links table and you are now ready to execute link related ZCommands.
<p>
In most cases ZCommands are executed by making a table selection and invoking commands from pop-up menus or toolbars.
Pop-up menus are invoked by right-clicking on some table selection you have made.
Depending on the type of editor, toolbars may also be available when you select something on a table inside the editor.
If a toolbar is available it contains only a subset of the full ZCommand set 
and this subset is usually the commands likely to be executed most often by the user.
This strategy helps to avoid clutter in the workspace.

<p>
A description of how to access ZCommands for each of the 7 target types is presented in the next section. Refer to the Command Reference for
specific information on individual ZCommands.
