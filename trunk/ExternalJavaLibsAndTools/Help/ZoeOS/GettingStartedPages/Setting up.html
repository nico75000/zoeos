	The first time you run ZoeOS it will auto-hunt for devices on all the ports it has access to - in future device hunts this can be time consuming
	if you have lots of ports and you know the Emulator will be permanently connected on one particular pair of in/out ports.
	From the menu item Manage/Midi you can set arbitrary ports to be <i>ignored</i> - in future ZoeOS will not try to hunt on these ports.
	A port that is <u>not</u> ignored is deemed <i>permitted</i>. Remember to permit any relevant ports when you introduce new Emulators to the system.

<p>
A SMDI connection to the Emulator is highly desirable, but ultimately not neccessary to use ZoeOS.
<p>
 SMDI enables:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Uploading and downloading of sample data
		</li>
		<li>
			Creating and loading of sample packages
		</li>
		<li>
			Inclusion of samples while creating and loading preset packages
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>	
To use SMDI in ZoeOS you will need a SCSI connection between the computer running ZoeOS and the Emulator. Refer to the Emulator manual on how
to make the SCSI connection.

<h4 id="smdi_coupling" class="default">SMDI coupling</h4>
<p>
	ZoeOS looks at the Emulator in two different ways - Midi and SMDI. Therefore you need to <i>couple</i> the Midi view to the SMDI view.
This is done through the SMDI Manager which is accessed from the Manage/SMDI menu item. If you have successfully made a SCSI connection you will see the Emulator listed in the
SMDI table. Select the relevant Emulator and press <i>Couple to midi device</i>. You will then be presented with a choice of Emulators that are already marshalled in the system.
Choose the relevant device to make the coupling.
