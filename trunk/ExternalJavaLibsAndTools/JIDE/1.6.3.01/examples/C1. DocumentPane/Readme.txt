Demo for JIDE Components and JIDE Docking Framework 1.2.5
                        ----    Released on 08/22/2003

***********************
    JIDE Components
***********************
Thousands and thousands of developers' valuable hours are wasted on building the
same component which has been built elsewhere. Why don't you focus on the most
value-add part in your application and we build those components for you? JIDE
Components is such a Java UI components library.
We developed and put together around several ready-to-use components or utilities
that you can use in your application. Please see below for available components.
The number is still growing. You will see more and more components in the future.

*******************************
    JIDE Docking Framework
*******************************
Swing or .NET? This is a decision that many IT developers need to make. Both have
pros and cons, depending on which one you care the most. If you happened to choose
Java and Swing, as we did, you probably found there aren't many ready-to-use
component in Swing as .NET has. An obviously missing one is dockable windows as
you see in Visual Studio .NET. However everything changed after JIDE releases JIDE
Docking Framework. Now, you can get the same features of dockable windows, but,
using purely Swing.
By taking advantage of Swing pluggable look and feel technology, we plan to make
several flavors of JIDE Docking Framework. So far we have released Visual
Studio .NET LookAndFeel, Eclipse LookAndFeel and default Swing Metal LookAndFeel.
However you can also create your own version look and feel.

**************
   Features
**************
* Provide your end-users powerful docking window functionality within minutes
* Uses the latest in user-interface design concepts, originated in Visual Studio
.NET
* Dock dockable frames on all sides of a central client area in the main window
* Dock several dockable frames in one area, displayed with tabs
* Place dockable frames in auto-hide mode for optimization of screen real estate
* Float dockable frames above the main window
* Dock dockable frames in any combination within floating frames
* Full support of a complex hierarchy of dockable frames in any area
* Show and hide dockable frames
* Load and save dockable window layout data directly to data files, or persist
layout data in some other media, such as a database
* Instantly switch between window layouts - useful for IDEs when state switching
occurs between Code and Runtime modes

etc.
* Provide full customizable status bar that you can use to display status,
progress, time and other information at the bottom of your application.
* Extended version TabbedPane and SplitPane. We used these two components
extensively in our other products.
