Suggested exe and msi builders for ZoeOs

= Introduction =

Installing and using ZoeOs will be easier if the application is started from a native exe and there is an installer. I have looked for free or open source tool which do these two tasks and found one tool for each task.


= Details =

Jsmooth is not a house music producer but an open source exe maker.

War setup is a decent msi builder and perfect for ZoeOs it needs the wix tool kit to be installed to use it.
