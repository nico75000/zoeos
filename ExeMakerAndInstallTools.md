Suggested exe and msi builders for ZoeOs

# Introduction #

Installing and using ZoeOs will be easier if the application is started from a native exe and there is an installer. I have looked for free or open source tool which do these two tasks and found one tool for each task.

War setup is a decent msi builder and perfect for ZoeOs it needs the wix tool kit to be installed to use it.
